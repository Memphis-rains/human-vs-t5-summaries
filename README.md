# ðŸ“Š Human vs T5 Summary Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project is an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) dashboard for comparing **human-written news summaries** to summaries generated by the **T5 transformer model**. It uses data sampled from the [CNN/DailyMail dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail) and showcases how to evaluate and visualize the quality of automatic text summarization.

## What Does This Project Do?

- **Loads and preprocesses paired summary data:**  
  Each sample contains a (human summary, T5 summary) pair, with additional metrics computed for each.

- **Visualizes comparison metrics:**  
  Displays side-by-side bar charts (mean counts) and density plots (distribution) for:
  - Word count
  - Sentence count
  - Character count
  - Punctuation usage
  - Readability (Flesch-Kincaid)
  - Compression ratio

- **Editable Observations:**  
  For every metric, you can add and display your own analysis notes and key insights right in the dashboard.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  Calculates and presents ROUGE, BLEU, cosine similarity, readability, and compression ratio for both human and T5 summaries.

- **Correlation Heatmap:**  
  Shows relationships between various evaluation metrics.

- **Demo Dataset:**  
  Uses a sample of 100 records for fast loading and demo. The repository will be updated with the full processed dataset in the future.

- **Summary Table & Conclusions:**  
  Shows a table of mean metric scores and a final section for your conclusions.
