"by . ruth styles . whether its stress or having a blazing row with your partner, the triggers that lead to comfort eating are myriad  and can cause you to pile on the pounds. now a psychologist and diet expert claims to have uncovered the emotional triggers that lead to comfort eating and what you can do to avoid them. dr jane mccartney says identifying the stresses that send you into a frenzy of comfort eating need to be identified before you can lose weight but adds that once you do, shifting excess pounds becomes easy. comfort food emotional triggers such as rows can lead to comfort eating  and piling on the pounds . weighty problem dr jane mccarthy says emotional eating is one of the chief causes of weight gain . first you need to identify that youre overeating whether thats with crisps, doughnuts, cake or whatever, she explains in an exclusive interview with mailonline. it could be something in the here and now  for instance, you might not be getting on with a colleague or you might have financial issues  or it could be something more long term such as having a feud with your neighbour or falling out with your parents. whether its a bad neighbour or a row with your other half, according to dr mccartney, its essential that you recognise when youre comfort eating rather than tucking in because youre genuinely hungry. you need to ask yourself am i eating because im hungry?, says dr mccartney. if youre not, then you need to find some motivation to do something about it. but if you genuinely are hungry then eat. britains burgeoning obesity crisis  the most recent figures show that 70 per cent of british people are overweight or obese  has been blamed on everything from sedentary lifestyles to sugary snacks. but thats not the whole story, says dr mccartney, who says that emotional reasons contribute a significant amount to britains bulging waistline. people are overweight for emotional reasons, reveals dr mccartney. its a huge problem and its not always recognised. people understand comfort eating like indulging in a bar of chocolate to get away from whats going on in your life at that moment. its a vicious cycle, and you need to get out of it. so what do you do when oscillating emotions send you reaching for the biscuits? dr mccartneys solution is what she describes as a 10minute selfintervention. flashpoints living with an unpleasant neighbour or rows with a partner are both common triggers . solution dr mccartney suggests giving yourself 10 minutes to reconsider before eating . if . youre in a coffee shop and you fancy a chocolate biscuit, wait 10 minutes before coming back to it to see if you still want it, she suggests. nine times out . of 10 you wont. if you ride the wave of anxiety, you will feel so much . better for not eating. but its not just about identifying your trigger points and stopping. dr mccartney, who is behind new book stop overeating the 28day plan to end emotional eating for good, says combining willpower with healthy eating is essential if you want to shift the pounds. im not saying that we shouldnt have . nice to things like crisps and chocolate to eat but everything in . moderation, she adds. these things are probably not the sort of thing you . should eat on a diet but i do think its a good idea to make an agreement with . yourself when you start the diet that you can always come back to these . foods when you come off the diet and its not forever. regardless of what you put in your mouth, key to losing weight is breaking the link between emotions and food, and slowing yourself down at mealtimes. if you eat . slowly you are conscious of what youre eating, explains dr mccartney. it can actually take . 10 to 20 minutes for your brain to give the signal that youre full, which means little tricks such as keeping a glass of water next to your . plate can really help. another . exercise i get people to do is to acknowledge the length of time . between having something in their mouths. we are constantly grazing . nowadays and we barely go 20 minutes without something going in our . mouth and its not always the good stuff. and to deal with the temptation to use food as a reward for completing a task? it . is great to reward yourself but just not necessarily with food, explains the psychologist. i . always recommend buying something else like a plant or a brooch, and it . doesnt have to be expensive. i knew a woman who would take herself down . to a charity shop and pick up a brooch for 20p and it would be so much . better because it represents her and its much longer lasting. stop overeating the 28day plan to end emotional eating for good by dr jane mccartney, 10.99, is published by vermillion . once youve worked out what your emotional triggers are, the next step is to start slimming down with a healthy diet. although snacking isnt banned, dr mccartney says making sure its healthy is key. there is nothing wrong with a tv snack so long as it is a healthy one one being the optimum word there, she writes, . one really good tip is to make the snack take as long as possible to eat, celery with a cottage cheese dip for example or half a dozen nuts in their shells. this is not just about the calories, it is about the time taken to eat. to satisfy your established grazing habits you almost have to trick yourself into believing that you are eating all the time, until you get into the habit of not doing so. heres what to eat for the first few days . day one . breakfast porridge made with 40 g  oz oats and water with cinnamon and a handful of raisins . lunch one crusty roll with one poached egg and one grilled sliced tomato . dinner tagliolini with almond pesto followed by spiced orange sorbet . day two . breakfast one toasted plain bagel filled with one tablespoon of soft cheese . lunch carrot and coriander soup with homemade croutons . dinner mushroom and thyme risotto followed by onequarter of a small shopbought flan casefilled with fruit, served with one tablespoon of single cream . day three . breakfast two slices of medium wholemeal bread filled with one grilled vegetarian sausage, sliced into four strips, one grilled sliced tomato . lunch one jacket potato no butter with two tablespoon of tuna canned in water or brine, drained and chopped cucumber . dinner fish and rustic chunky chips followed by bought meringue nest, one tablespoon fromagefras with grated dark chocolate topping .",dr jane mccartney says emotional eating is a major cause of weight gain . suggests tricks to help overcome the urge to eat when youre not hungry . suggests a 10minute selfintervention to help beat comfort eating . says its easier to shift the pounds once you know your emotional triggers .,79,1240,5249,0.06370967741935483,4.233064516129033,121,507,1240,52,79,4,5249,238,dr jane mccartney says emotional triggers can lead to comfort eating. says you need to identify the stresses that send you into a frenzy of comfort eating. dr mccarthy says emotional eating is one of the chief causes of weight gain.
"cnnten dollars  thats all that rwandan science teacher cephas nshimyumuremyi had to start his business with two years ago. it may sound less than promising, but nshimyumuremyi made that initial initial investment go a long way. today, his company uburanga products, which makes herbal jelly and soap from local medicinal plants, is worth 30,000 and employs 12 workers. the 10 helped me to purchase the empty bottle in order to put my product on the market, says nshimyumuremyi, winner of the educat  gt bank entrepreneurship award 2014, a local business prize. his idea for natural cosmetics with healing properties came from trying to teach his students how the science they were learning in class could be applied in practical ways i teach chemistry so i showed my students how you can test a plant, and know the capacity of that plant to kill bacteria, says the young entrepreneur, who launched his company in a bid to supplement his income from teaching . nshimyumuremyi also wanted to use the local medicinal plants, used by some traditional healers, in a scientific way. he says his future goal is to provide the solution for some skin diseases in africa. start with little, use your knowledge herbs used in nshimyumuremyis remedies are grown in a botanical garden, then dried and mixed to create either soap or jelly. the products made by uburanga help the skin to be smooth and they protect from bacteria which can cause skin disease, says the entrepreneur. like with many new businesses, the greatest challenge nshimyumuremyi had to overcome was getting the word about his product out to a wider audience, without having money to advertise. another was the high cost of containers in which his products are sold, which he had to import in our country there is no industry producing such kind of bottles and cartons, so we purchase them from kampala uganda, nshimyumuremyi says. his message to fellow wouldbe entrepreneurs thinking of starting a business is encouraging dont think that you need a lot of capital, he says. start with little, but use the knowledge and the environment that you already have. check out the video below to find out more about nshimyumuremyis efforts to grow his cosmetics company. read this got an idea? theres 100 million available... read this catch a ride on a bamboo bike . more african startup .",science teacher cephas nshimyumuremyi started his skincare company with just 10 . he produces herbal soaps and jellies made of local medicinal plants . the entrepreneur says you dont need a lot of capital to start a business .,17,432,1941,0.03935185185185185,4.493055555555555,43,168,432,39,17,3,1941,188,"rwandan science teacher cephas nshimyumuremyi launched his company uburanga products. the company is worth 30,000 and employs 12 workers. nshimyumuremyi wanted to use the local medicinal plants in a scientific way."

"cnn  how could they not have known they were asking for trouble? in the past few years, rep. mark souder of indiana had an affair with the staff member who had helped him produce a video promoting sexual abstinence. south carolina gov. mark sanford flew to argentina for an extramarital tryst, instructing his staff to tell the press he was hiking the appalachian trail. sen. john edwards tried to pass off the daughter he fathered as the love child of one of his aides. and now a stockpile of sexy emails has simultaneously brought down the head of the cia and delayed the nomination of the top u.s. commander in afghanistan to head nato. many americans believe these scandals reflect a precipitous decline in respect for marital fidelity. if anything, however, such respect has never been higher. in a 2006 poll by the pew research center, 88 of americans said adultery was immoral  a higher number than for any other of 10 unsavory behaviors they were asked about. according to a 2009 gallup poll, only 6 of americans believe extramarital sex is morally acceptable. tolerance for male adultery is certainly at a new low. in letters and diaries written during the colonial and revolutionary eras, men routinely bragged about their extramarital conquests  even to the brothers and fathers of their own wives! in the 1850s, it is estimated that new york city had one prostitute for every 64 men, while the mayors of savannah, georgia, and norfolk, virginia, put the numbers of prostitutes in their cities at one for every 39 and 26 men, respectively. as late as 1930, somserset maughams play, the constant wife, was considered shocking because the heroine confronted her husband about his affair instead of simply ignoring it, as most women in polite circles did. opinion ok to flirt your way to the top? president thomas jefferson fathered a child by his mistress. so did warren g. harding, who also carried on an affair with the wife of a family friend. gen. dwight eisenhower had a longterm relationship with the woman who was his driver in england during world war ii. cia director allen dulles, according to his own sister, had at least a hundred affairs, including one with the queen of greece. president john f. kennedys affairs and onenight stands may have numbered even more. but times have changed. the press and political insiders no longer turn a blind eye. so why do men continue in behaviors that now carry so much risk of exposure and punishment? part of it is probably a sense of entitlement. powerful men have people to take care of the mundane details of life. they are briefed on the names and backgrounds of whomever they meet, told when its time to leave, and extricated from awkward encounters. someone else keeps track of appointments, money and time, fetches whatever they have forgotten at home, makes excuses when they change plans, and picks up after them when they leave a room. no wonder they get careless about picking up after their indiscretions as well. but why do equally powerful women so seldom engage in such risky affairs? some believe that the very qualities that make men successful also make them vulnerable. powerful men are rewarded for being risk takers, a political consultant once told me, whereas women feel more need to control their emotions and impulses if they are to succeed. there is some truth to this. but i think the answer is more complex, and in some ways sadder. after all, these men dont necessarily take such risks in other areas where emotions run strong. political leaders calibrate their positions, moral convictions and emotional impulses with a degree of calculation that would put machiavelli to shame. many even shove aside their most deeply held beliefs at the faintest hint that these might expose them to risk. as someone who has studied the evolution of love, sexuality, and marriage over the centuries, i believe the frequency of these sexual scandals reflects the fact that many men and women have still not fully incorporated into their daily emotional lives the new ideals about gender equity and mutuality that have emerged in the past 40 years. opinion media, stop stoking petraeus sex saga . today many  perhaps most  men sincerely want to marry women who are partners rather than subordinates. and women now want careers of their own, whether paid or unpaid, rather than defining themselves entirely through a husbands achievements. yet many of our romantic fantasies and cues for sexual arousal are still shaped by the unequal division of roles, power, resources and prescribed character traits that prevailed from the early 19th century up through the 1960s. before industrialization moved production outside the household unit, husbands and wives were partners in homebased production, equally responsible for provisioning the household and dealing with the details of daily life. but the experiences and emotions of men and women diverged as men began to earn money outside the home while women concentrated on meeting family needs. gradually, women came to see success, prosperity and status as only attainable through the achievements of men, while men became accustomed to receiving love and admiration for possessing skills, resources, and knowledge to which women did not have access. women began to equate admiration with attraction men began to equate being looked up to with being sexually potent. for 150 years, romance novels and the mass media have reinforced this confusion. opinion lessons from petraeus sex scandal . i think this pattern helps explain why so few women are tempted by the adoration of younger acolytes but often fall for superiors or mentors, while many otherwise happily married men become so intoxicated by admiration that they risk their careers and families for its temporary rush. president bill clinton couldnt resist the heroworship of a white house intern. thenhouse speaker newt gingrich carried on an affair with an admiring female aide while trying to impeach clinton for lying about a similar indiscretion. presidential candidate john edwards fell for the woman who followed him around with an adoring camera as well as an adoring gaze. rep. anthony wiener apparently thought any woman who admired his political views would be turned on by an unsolicited picture of his crotch. and like his cia predecessor allen dulles, whose affair with journalist mary bancroft was based on the excitement of what she described as her overwhelming admiration, david petraeus bonded with his own worshipful biographer. some of the men involved in these scandals are clearly pigs. some of the women are opportunists. but most are otherwise decent people who have not yet been able to adjust 200 years of conditioned sexual responses to our evolving emotional and intellectual preferences. the challenge facing modern couples  not just the men and women in these scandals  is to root out our old psychological habits and incorporate our new expectations of love and marriage into our deepest emotional core. we will know we have made progress when equality and friendship become more sexy than adoration and uncertainty. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of stephanie coontz.","stephanie coontz male politicians repeatedly step into illicit sex situations. why?

"sometimes geography gets in the way of power politics. just when you thought that ukraine was miles away from syria, bang  you find out that theyre actually bordering each other. confused? i bet you are. but heres the deal the civil war in ukraine, which most sensible people tend to classify these days as a direct standoff between russia and the u.s., is now having a direct impact on the conflict in syria. the socalled islamic state isis  its better to keep it in quotation marks and add socalled, so as not to give these terrorists legitimacy  has emerged as a force that has created a socalled caliphate and vows to spread its borders way beyond syria and iraq, where it is currently operating. russia is supporting president bashar alassads regime in syria, while america and its allies are backing the antigovernment rebels there  some of whom have at some point developed into isis and started to get all sorts of crazy ideas. since it is assads troops who are actually doing the fighting on the ground against isis and since it so happens that this new menace is now the number one target of america, it follows that ukraine is very close to syria when it comes to international powerplay. this week, out of the blue, the alreadydisbanded ukrainian parliament voted to provide special status for donetsk and lugansk  the two rebellious regions in eastern ukraine  offering them autonomy for three years and allowing them to hold their own elections for their local authorities, in addition to offering an amnesty for people who have not been directly involved in fighting ukrainian government troops. initially this was received with caution in moscow  especially given what has been going on for the past nine months in ukraine  but if that is not a signal from barack obama that he is ready to play ball with russia, then i dont know what is. the view in moscow is that the obama administration is telling the kremlin that it needs help in dealing with isis. but as it cant just say it publicly, it is using ukrainian president petro poroshenko to do the honors. i am told that the initial reaction in the kremlin to obamas plan to fight isis was not exactly a kind one. the suspicion was that washington, together with its allies, was planning to use the campaign against isis in syria to dispose of assad through the back door, so to speak. an antiterrorist operation targeted at isis gets out of control and all sorts of wrong targets get hit, like, say, syrian army positions. one thing leads to another and, lo and behold, we have assad going down the route of colonel gadhafi, and syria descends into the same kind of chaos that is now gripping libya. but after the border between ukraine and syria emerged all of a sudden, that attitude is changing. but the broad antiisis coalition that obama is hoping to build is not exactly shaping up as planned. turkey is openly hesitant to get involved, and the saudis are not exactly over the moon with the whole concept. so obamas best bet to get the ball rolling, as it is now seen from moscow, would be to discreetly work with russia. although it may be tempting for washington to overthrow assad, such a move could backfire on the white house, giving isis a boost instead of a kick and turning those pesky u.s. midterm elections into a total nightmare for the democrats. incidentally, russian experts believe that obama will lose the senate and will being to resemble a lateterm bill clinton, who improved his golf swing dramatically in his last years in office. so it made sense for washington to wave the white flag  albeit a very small one  at the expense of the ukrainian regime in kiev, in order to signal to the kremlin that it is time to do some business together. russian president vladimir putin has his own plan for syria. sergey lavrov, his top diplomat, has made a point of stressing the point that without the syrian regime on board, any attempt to defeat isis wont work. a similar scenario to the one that had been used to prevent the u.s. bombing syria last year is shaping up nicely in moscow. russia will ask the u.s. to cooperate with assad in the battle against isis, without the syrian president having to fear that he might be bumped off along the way. the hawks in washington might not like this script, but hey, stranger things have happened in power politics in the past. what will putin ask for in return for helping to defeat isis? thats the question that is probably being mulled over in the white house as you read this. well, it just so happens that sorting out the mess in eastern ukraine is putins personal project  just like syria was last year. he will want some sort of guarantee that kiev will stick to the new deal about the special status of donetsk and lugansk which should help calm things down in the eastern provinces, at least until next spring. that would be a deal that the kremlin would consider worthwhile. but the funniest thing of all is that the broad coalition obama proposed may never see the light of day  and at that point, the only countries that will actually be able to help the u.s. fight isis would be iraq, iran, syria and russia, with the latter mostly providing the weaponry to the syrians. which is not really all that surprising if you consider how closely ukraine and syria are intertwined. read more opinion should u.s. arm ukraine?

he would have no objection to a similar service when mr blair passes away. whitehall sources dismissed claims that it had already been decided that future prime ministers would not be afforded

maude, asked about plans for mr blairs demise, and whether he envisaged a similar funeral to that of lady thatcher, told bbc radio 5s pienaars politics i dont think its for me to say actually. i certainly wouldnt object to that at all. i think thats very much to be decided between the government of the day and the family. i think the wishes of the family should be paramount and the wishes of the person themselves. a whitehall source said there had been no detailed discussion about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers  mr blair, sir john major and gordon brown. at only 70, john major is now the oldest living former prime minister  the lowest age for the holder of that position at any time since world war two. but the source added francis maude has made it clear he would not object to a similar scale of funeral for tony blair, who like margaret thatcher did win three general elections. no decision a whitehall source said there had been no detailed discussion about funeral services for any of the surviving former prime ministers  mr blair, sir john major and gordon brown. whether you like him or not, that is quite a big deal. given the relative youth of our former prime ministers there has not been any detailed planning for this. margaret thatcher left very detailed instructions and most former prime ministers will have a clear idea of what they want. deputy prime minister nick clegg defended the use of taxpayers money for lady thatchers funeral, dismissing the objections of some labour mps by pointing out plans had been agreed under the governments of mr blair and mr brown. questioned mr maude was asked about plans for mr blairs funeral on bbc radio 5s pienaars politics . theres nothing new about the government of the day supporting funeral costs for significant public figures and, of course, former prime ministers  that is actually quite an established convention and has happened before, he told lbc radio. these plans were not suddenly invented out of thin air, these were worked on over a long period of time, were pretty well established in detail by the previous government, not this coalition government, and of course with the full consent, cooperation and support of the family. of course, i can hear that there are people who have differing views but whether you are for or against margaret thatcher, everybody recognises she was a very significant political figure and this was a big occasion and that it was done on a crossparty basis. mr maude said the bill will be much, much less than the widelyreported figure of 10 million, but no official estimate of the cost has yet been released. the prime ministers spokesman said we will publish the costs in due course. i think people will understand it can take a little time to draw together the final costings for highprofile and significant events such as yesterdays funeral. that is what is being done, and we will publish the costs. asked whether the figure would include the full cost of the thousands of police and military personnel who were present at yesterdays event, the spokesman said it will take account of the fact that a significant proportion of the personnel involved in the funeral ceremony would already have been on working duty. sir mark thatcher said yesterday that his mother would have been profoundly moved and gratified by wednesdays

"irbil, iraq cnn  turkish soldiers and tanks took up position along the border with syria on tuesday as its government debated whether to deploy troops to battle the islamic state terror group, a move that comes as tens of thousands pour into the country to escape isis fighters. the flood of refugees from syria has escalated  with 150,000 people fleeing to turkey in recent days  as isis fighters armed with tanks and heavy weapons advance on the predominantly kurdish town of kobani, known in arabic as ayn al arab, destroying villages in their path. isis fighters were just three kilometers nearly two miles east of the northern syria town late monday, a civilian in kobani told cnn on condition of anonymity. cnn cannot independently confirm the claim, though it matches reports released by the syrian observatory for human rights, a monitoring group. u.s. airstrikes overnight targeted isis positions near kobani, said rear adm. john kirby, spokesman for the pentagon. it was unclear whether the strikes stopped the isis advance, and kirby provided only cursory details about what they targeted and what damage may have resulted. when asked why airstrikes in the kobani area appear to be limited, a senior u.s. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a lack of direct, reliable intelligence on the ground and the need to be precise to avoid civilian casualties were among the factors. poll americans back airstrikes, but oppose use of u.s. troops . turkey considers going after isis . if isis takes kobani, it would control a complete swath of land from its selfdeclared capital of raqqa to the turkish border, more than 100 kilometers 60 miles away. it has been fighting for months, capturing portions of northern and eastern syria and western and northern iraq for what it says is its new islamic state  or caliphate. the turkish parliament on tuesday took up the issue whether to send troops into iraq and syria to fight isis. the debate was expected to continue into the latter part of the week before lawmakers voted, according to anadolu, turkeys semiofficial news agency. turkey has said it is offering support to a u.s.led coalition targeting isis, but has stopped short of joining the 40some countries who make up the coalition. but with more than 150,000 refugees pouring into the country since last week, adding to the hundreds of thousands who have already fled the syrian civil war, and concerns about isis controlling border points, turkish lawmakers are taking up the issue. obama assesses isis strategy . at the same time, u.s. president barack obama met with his national security council to discuss what white house officials described as a comprehensive strategy to counter the threat posed by isis, also known as isil. the meeting follows obamas admission on cbs 60 minutes that the united states underestimated the strength of isis and overestimated the ability of the iraqi security forces to fight the group. nowhere was that assessment more evident than in reports isis had seized another iraqi military base about 80 kilometers 50 miles west of baghdad over the weekend. dozens of isis fighters attacked the albu aytha military base, north of ramadi, where 180 iraqi soldiers were stationed, according to faleh alessawi, deputy head of the anbar provincial council. isis has been fanning out across the sunnidominated anbar region in recent months, targeting bases one by one across the vast area. syrian town fears massacre obama admits underestimating rise of isis . about a week ago, details emerged regarding the massacre of more than 100 iraqi soldiers at bases in saqlawiyah and sejar, also near ramadi. a handful of survivors accused the iraqi government of failing to respond to pleas for help ahead of the final isis assault on the base, after a dayslong siege. isis overruns military base . while the majority of soldiers withdrew from the albu aytha base prior to it being overrun sunday by isis fighters, a number of soldiers appear to have been killed. images posted online by isis purport to show the takeover of the base in question, and include images of men dressed in uniform who appear to be dead iraqi soldiers. while cnn cannot independently verify the authenticity of the isis images, giveaway features on the base and in the landscape do appear to show western iraq, specifically, and very likely the base in question. isis also seized a large weapons cache left behind at the base, alessawi said. amid the continuing violence, a string of car bombs and mortar attacks hit iraqi cities, leaving dozens dead. in baghdad, two car bombs and seven mortar attacks struck primarily shiite neighborhoods, killing at least nine people and wounding 40, police officials said. car bombs also exploded in the predominantly shiite cities of hilla, karbala and basra, iraqiya state tv reported. all three are south of the iraqi capital. uk carries out first airstrikes . the attacks came the same day that the united kingdom said it conducted its first airstrikes against isis in iraq, striking targets four days after parliament voted to approve the countrys involvement. british planes helped kurdish troops who were fighting isis in northwestern iraq, dropping a bomb on an isis heavy weapon position and shooting a missile at an armed pickup truck, the uks defense ministry said. an initial assessment indicates both strikes were successful, according to the ministry. british planes had been involved in reconnaissance missions over iraq in the days since lawmakers approved uk airstrikes against isis in iraq on friday, but tuesdays strikes were a first. britain joins the united states and france as countries that have hit isis in iraq with airstrikes, while belgium and denmark have

"by . andy dolan . abbi kinsella, 54, dressed in her witch costume, before she stole tens of thousands from her mother . for a woman convicted of swindling her own elderly mother out her 100,000 life savings, it is a somewhat appropriate outfit. posing as a wicked witch, abbi kinsella is pictured ahead of a fancy dress party in the snap uploaded to facebook two years ago. kinsella now faces jail after a jury took just 20 minutes to convict her of stealing the cash from her 88yearold mother, margaret bowyer, who suffers from dementia. the court heard the pensioner ended up on the street and penniless after kinsella, 54, used 34,000 of the money to feed her online bingo habit and had also holidayed in the exclusive resort of st tropez in the south of france. kinsella, whose home has a sign outside featuring a black plastic crow above the warning beware of the witch, also used 200 of her mothers money on a sky tv subscription, the court heard. prosecutor andrew wallace said mrs bowyer moved in to a rented home next door to her duplicitous daughter in tamworth staffordshire, after selling her own property in swadlincote, derbyshire, and banking the money from the sale. but over the next three years, more than 61,000 was transferred from mrs bowyers bank account to kinsellas, and in addition there were 244 cash withdrawals totalling more than 38,000. after plundering the account, kinsella cancelled her mothers rent and direct debit payments in april 2011. as a result, the pensioner, who was too ill to give evidence, was eventually evicted from her rented home in november 2012, stafford crown court was told. the home centre with car on drive of kinsella in fazeley, near tamworth, staffordshire . mr wallace said kinsella had totally abused her position as mrs

funding her bingo habit. she has fleeced her mother. social services referred mrs bowyers case to the police in november 2012 and her daughter was arrested a month later. when questioned, kinsella said she had stopped rent payments going out of the account in april 2011 because the owner of the property owed them some money for doing the back garden. the somewhat appropriate sign nailed to the house of abbi kinsella, who caused her mother to be evicted due to continued theft . she said she had restarted rent payments in cash, but hadnt got any receipts for it. kinsella, a onetime avon lady now said by neighbours to work at birmingham airport, claimed she had given the money transferred back to mrs bowyer in cash. she denied using the money for her own gain, but when asked if she knew what her mother had done with 212 a week, kinsella said no. the prosecutor at kinsellas trial argued how she had abused her position and had thrown her mother out on the street kinsella denied four charges of theft from her mother, who was too ill to give evidence, but admitted one offence of fraud. following the jurys verdict on monday, judge mark eades told her i dont want you to be under any illusions, you should prepare yourself for a custodial sentence. kinsella was remanded on bail and will be sentenced after a presentence report has been prepared. detective constable mark woodings, the officer who carried out the investigation for staffordshire police, said the victim is an extremely vulnerable elderly lady. when she became unable to manage her own financial affairs due to the onset of dementia, the family entrusted kinsella to look after her interests and welfare. kinsella went on to abuse that trust in a most heartless and callous way, stealing every penny of her mothers life savings. she systematically and repeatedly helped herself to more than 100,000 in order to feed a gambling habit and to live a life beyond her means. her actions have left a proud lady homeless, penniless and in debt for the first time in her life. mrs bowyer is now thought to be living in a care home in tamworth. there was no sign of divorced kinsella at the modern threebedroom terrace she shares with partner john causer, 53, a building worker, in tamworth. neighbours said the couple regularly held fancy dress parties and said kinsella had been known to dress up as a witch. it is an

"chiquita chavis is an army reservist who served in afghanistan and is waiting to see if shell be deployed for a second time. but since returning from her first tour in 2010, she has fallen on hard times. she came back to find that the civilian job she left had been restructured, and with only parttime work, she struggled to make ends meet for herself and her young daughter. they ended up living in a friends garage. i never had to live in the street, said chavis, 30. but i was not in a situation where i could support myself on my own. chavis is not alone. while the department of veterans affairs reports that overall veteran homeless rates are going down, female rates are going up. in fact, female veterans are the fastestgrowing segment of the u.s. homeless population and are more at risk than their male counterparts, according to the report. read the report on veterans homeless rates pdf the va says veterans become homeless for many reasons, including mental health issues and substance abuse. but it notes that female veterans can face additional challenges, such as sexual abuse. female veterans are also more likely to be single parents, the va says, which can make it more difficult to find adequate housing. chavis luck changed at a job fair when she met jaspen boothe, a captain with the army national guard. within days, boothe had helped chavis and her daughter move to a transitional home where they could stay until they got back on their feet. boothe, 35, considers it her mission to help her female comrades who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. since 2011, she has provided transitional housing or financial assistance to more than 50 female veterans and their children through her nonprofit, final salute. not every veteran is living under a bridge, boothe said. not all veterans have mental issues. not all veterans have experienced substance abuse. some veterans have just fallen on hard times. when they do fall, it can be hard for female veterans with children to find housing, according to the government accountability office. it reported that 60 of the homeless shelters that serve female veterans dont accept children or have restrictions based on age or the number of children that can be housed. read the gao report on veterans and housing pdf in the past two years, boothe has opened two transitional homes in the virginia suburbs of washington, where veterans and their children can live for up to two years while they get their lives back on track. her nonprofit also offers them assistance with child care, employment placement and accessing benefits or counseling through the va. do you know a hero? nominations are open for 2013 cnn heroes . we offer wraparound services ... anything they could possibly need to help get themselves back in a state of independence, boothe said. we give all the tools that you need, but your success in this program is up to you. additionally, boothe works to prevent homelessness by providing interestfree loans or grants to help female veterans pay for rent, deposit and utilities. to date, shes helped 100 women and children through her programs, and she has given plenty of personal support and encouragement along the way. i definitely am someone who relates to them on their level, she said. i let them know hey, you can get past your circumstances. theyre only temporary. she should know she was once homeless herself. as a single mother, boothe joined the army reserves to make a better life for herself and her young son. she was based in new orleans and set to deploy to iraq in 2005 when her life was turned upside down. hurricane katrina hit. boothe and her son were fine  shed already sent him to live with a relative in missouri while she prepared to deploy  but the family lost everything, and boothe became homeless. a month later, she was diagnosed with head, neck and throat cancer. she underwent surgery and radiation treatment at brooke army medical center in texas, but she was eventually discharged from the reserves because of her illness. when boothe asked the va what assistance was available for her, she was told they didnt have any programs that could help with the challenges she was facing as a female veteran with a dependent child. they referred her to local social services, which boothe called probably the most demeaning experience of her life. youre treated basically as a babys mama or a crack head, or some woman whos made a bunch of bad decisions with her life, and the only resources available were welfare, boothe said. im not a welfare mom, im a soldier. boothe joined her young son in missouri, where she was able to eventually get her life back together. today, her cancer is in remission, and she lives with her son, her new husband and their son in virginia, where she is on active duty with the army national guard. for years, boothe considered her experience an isolated incident. but when she realized that other female veterans were struggling, too, she decided to take action. for her, its part of the oath she swore to uphold when she entered the service. as a soldier, you raise your right hand, and with that comes certain responsibilities, she said. one of those is to never leave a fallen comrade. ... so whether theyre in or out of uniform, they have me if they need me. boothes help has given chavis the break she needed. i have a job now, and i got promoted in like two weeks, chavis said. im really at peace here, and i can focus on what my next steps are. ... jas set me up for success. boothe is determined to help as many female veterans as she can. at the end of the month, shell be getting another opportunity when she starts her dream job working in women veterans outreach at the va. one way or another, her ultimate goal is to make organizations like hers obsolete. i dont have a blueprint, but im going to figure it out, she said. its my duty as a soldier to help my fellow sisters. want to get involved?

"moscow, russia reuters  russias strategic bombers have resumed the soviet unions cold war practice of flying longhaul missions to areas patrolled by nato and the united states, generals said on thursday. a russian tu95 bear bomber, the type of plane used on longrange sorties into areas patrolled by nato. a russian bomber flew over a u.s. military base on the pacific island of guam on wednesday and exchanged smiles with u.s. pilots who had scrambled to track it, said maj. gen. pavel androsov, head of longrange aviation in the russian air force. it has always been the tradition of our longrange aviation to fly far into the ocean, to meet u.s. aircraft carriers and greet u.s. pilots visually, androsov told a news conference. yesterday we revived this tradition, and two of our young crews paid a visit to the area of the u.s. pacific naval activities base of guam, he said. president vladimir putin has sought to make russia more assertive in the world. putin has boosted defense spending and sought to raise morale in the armed forces, which were starved of funding in the chaos that followed the fall of the soviet union. androsov said the sortie by the two turboprop tu95ms bombers, from a base near blagoveshchensk in the far east, had lasted for 13 hours. the tu95, codenamed bear by nato, is russias cold war icon and may stay in service until 2040. i think the result was good. we met our colleagues  fighter jet pilots from u.s. aircraft carriers. we exchanged smiles and returned home, androsov said. u.s. officials told cnn, however, that the two bombers came no closer than 100 miles to any u.s. aircraft and no closer than 300 miles to the navy ships, and that there was no visual contact. ivan safranchuk, moscow office director of the washingtonbased world security institute, said he saw nothing extraordinary in moscow sending its bombers around the globe. this practice as such never stopped, it was only scaled down because there was less cash available for that, he said. it doesnt cost much to flex your muscles ... you can burn fuel flying over your own land or you can do it flying somewhere like guam, in which case political dividends will be higher. the bombers give russia the capability of launching a devastating nuclear strike even if the nuclear arsenals on its own territory are wiped out. during the cold war, they played elaborate airborne games of catandmouse with western air forces. lt. gen. igor khvorov, air force chief of staff, said the west would have to come to terms with russia asserting its geopolitical presence around the globe. but i dont see anything unusual, this is business as usual ... like it is normal for the u.s. to fly from its continent to guam or, say, the island of diegogarcia, khvorov said, referring to a remote indian ocean atoll used as a military base by the u.s. on wednesday,young pilots of strategic bombers passed a series of tests, including missile launches. we fired eight cruise missiles, and all hit bulls eye, khvorov said. he said one crew had taken off from engels in southwestern russia, hit a target in the north and then flown thousands of kilometers before finally landing in the far east. engels is home to russias supersonic tupolev tu160 strategic bombers, in service since 1987 and codenamed blackjack by nato while called white swan by russian pilots. the generals said under putin longrange aviation was no longer hindered by a lack of fuel, the aircraft enjoyed better maintenance and the crews much higher wages  not the least because the kremlin leader once made a fivehour sortie as part of a white swan crew. the president learned about the pilots work the hard way, khvorov said. this one flight yielded an awful lot. email to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters. all rights reserved.this material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.","russian strategic bombers resume cold warstyle longhaul missions . russian, u.s. crews exchanged smiles as bomber flew over u.s. pacific base . bombers enable russia to launch nuke strike even if ground arsenals wiped out .",28,730,3197,0.038356164383561646,4.379452054794521,102,253,730,37,28,3,3197,188,"moscow, russia reuters russias strategic bombers resume cold war practice. a russian bomber flew over a u.s. military base on the pacific island of guam. a russian bomber exchanged smiles with u.s. pilots who had scrambled to track it."
"cnn  for the second time in two days, security forces fired live ammunition and lobbed tear gas during protests in change square outside sanaa university on sunday, alaa alkhowlani, a witness at the scene, said. other witnesses told cnn that at least 10 people were injured. the clashes began after progovernment demonstrators and security forces set up a road block preventing antigovernment protesters from entering change square, witnesses said. while protesters were allowed to leave, they were not allowed to reenter. antigovernment protesters demanded they be allowed in, and tensions heightened when they forced themselves through the road block, witnesses said. after the protesters made their way in, the shooting started and tear gas was used, they reported. according to alkhowlani, some believe that security forces and police dressed as civilians were shooting into the crowd from nearby rooftops. in aden city on sunday, four protesters were injured by security forces gunfire, witnesses there said. one day earlier, three people in aden city died from gunshot wounds when security forces tried to disperse an antigovernment rally, a medical official with the group youth for change said. a fourth person was killed in dar saad, in aden province, when a group of antigovernment protesters stormed a government complex and set a police station on fire, the medical official said. a yemeni interior ministry official acknowledged that one person was killed by security forces, but said those who raided the complex were gang members and not protesters. regarding the killings in aden city, a security official called the demonstrators separatists rather than protesters, and would not comment on the alleged shootings by security forces. the government is trying to keep people as safe as possible, the official said. across yemen, high unemployment fuels much of the anger among a growing young population steeped in poverty. the protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. on thursday, president ali abdullah saleh  who has promised not to run for president in the next round of elections  pledged to bring a new constitution to a vote by the end of the year and transfer government power to an elected parliamentary system. human rights watch released a statement saturday, calling on countries that support saleh to make aid contingent on the government stopping its attacks on demonstrators. president saleh has once again broken his promise to end attacks on peaceful protesters, and those who supply his government with weapons risk complicity in this bloodshed, said joe stork, deputy middle east and north africa director at the rights organization.","antigovernment protesters wanted to enter change square . security forces set up a road block . protesters forced their way in . security forces responded by shooting and lobbing tear gas, witnesses say .",18,471,2275,0.03821656050955414,4.830148619957537,46,158,471,35,18,4,2275,171,"security forces fire live ammunition and lobbed tear gas during protests in change square. protesters were allowed to leave, but were not allowed to reenter. tensions heightened when they forced themselves through the road block, witnesses say."
"when 66yearold actress alison steadman recently revealed she has no time for expensive face creams and moisturises with nivea crme to keep her skin looking youthful, i rejoiced. i have been using budget face creams for 33 years, ever since my mother bought me my first pot of ponds dry skin cream, aged 13, and told me it was all id need for a great complexion. shed also started using it when she was a teenager and, while shes never set foot in a beauty salon, her skin still looks incredible at 71. put to the test claire cisotti applied the different creams to each side of her face for a month to see which was better . though we were both distraught when our favourite moisturiser was discontinued ten years ago, we didnt turn to anything expensive. instead, we stuck with ponds and started using their triple action cream instead  at the price of just 4.49 a pot. cheap moisturiser devotees include kate winslet, 37, and the perennially youthful joan collins, 80  who have both admitted using nivea crme. but can a potion that costs just over 1 really compete with such a luxury brand? i decided to put them both to the test. for 30 days i would moisturise the left side of my face with nivea crme  1.15 for 30ml. on the other side i would use crme de la mer  105 for 30ml. while nivea crme, which comes in distinctive blue pots, was first launched in germany in 1911 and contains everyday ingredients such as glycerin, crme de la mer has a more exciting heritage and formula. it was invented half a century ago by aerospace physicist dr max huber to heal his skin after a routine lab experiment exploded in his face, leaving him with chemical burns. which fights wrinkles better? the budget buy nivea or expensive creme de la mer? its secret weapon is a miracle broth, made from a blend of fermented seaweed, vitamins and minerals thats been treated with sound waves. according to the company website crme de la mer has the power to transform the look of skin. in a short time, skin appears firmer, lines, wrinkles and pores appear less visible, skin looks virtually ageless. its quite a claim. before i started, i had my skin tested by nicolas miedzianowskisinclair, of the cosmetic imaging studio  which provides 3d images for people considering cosmetic procedures, using a visia machine to scan my face. he would then retest at the end of my experiment. developed by nasa to monitor the effects of radiation and zero gravity on astronauts skin, the visia uses different types of light exposure to measure wrinkles, sun damage, redness and pore size. according to nicolas, while my wrinkles and fine lines are better than average for my age  i turn 47 soon  my skin is quite dehydrated. he also highlights the mild rosacea i inherited from my mum which often leaves my complexion, especially my cheeks, looking red. bargain buyers actresses alison steadman, left , and kate winslet are said to use nivea cream . so how would nivea crme and crme de la mer perform against each other? which would be crowned the crme de la crme of face creams? heres the diary of my month... on the first morning, i gently cleanse my face with my usual garnier gentle cleansing milk 3.05, then apply the crme de la mer on the right side. you are provided with a scoop to ensure you use the correct amount  a blob the size of a large pea  that you first have to warm between your fingers before it goes translucent and is ready to be applied. according to the makers, this activates the ingredients. the white cream, which doesnt have a scent, is then pressed in, not rubbed, so it doesnt drag the skin. but its so thick that i have to pat for ages before it is absorbed. i have sensitive skin, which goes red and itchy if i apply harsh creams, but theres no reaction to the crme de la mer. then, on the other side, i use the same amount of nivea crme, which is white and even more thicktextured, and pat that into the left side. scientific research claire had her skin tested before and after using the creams by nicolas miedzianowskisinclair, of the cosmetic imaging studio . the nivea just seems to vanish into my face. i was worried it might be too harsh, but again theres no adverse reaction. i quickly get into my new beauty routine. at this stage, i cant see any difference between the two sides, but after a couple of days i see my beauty therapist, nicola. she thinks that while both halves of my face feel very smooth, the left side of my face is glowing in particular  an early lead for nivea. meanwhile, i think my face is slightly less red on the right side. perhaps crme de la mer does have a magic calming effect. a cluster of painful pimples has developed on the right side of my nose. as thats the crme de la mer side, my husband jokes that they are the most expensive spots ill ever have. i wonder if the rich cream is blocking my pores, so avoid applying any cream there for a day or two. it also becomes clear that using crme de la mer is incredibly time consuming. normally i can shower, moisturise all over and get dressed in 15 minutes. but measuring and warming the cream, then gently patting it into my skin, adds ten minutes to my morning routine. faded the lines around claires eyes are reduced after using the nivea cream, right . by the middle of the week, the spots have gone and both sides of my face are feeling smooth and looking very healthy. it must help that we are on holiday in corsica. as advised by nicolas miedzianowskisinclair, im applying factor 50 to my face and chest, so am keeping tanning to a minimum. i cant see much difference between either side of my face, but when you consider one cream costs 100 more, its incredible how well the nivea is performing. ive reached the halfway point. i examine my face closely with a mirror, and think the lines on the left side are a little less visible around my eyes and my skin seems plumper, too. sadly, at the end of the week we have to return home. i wonder how the creams will perform once im back to spending ten hours a day in an airconditioned office. back at work, i ask everyone to look at my face to see if there is any difference, and if so which half looks best  everyone picks the left side. not once during the experiment has anyone picked the crme de la mer side. by now both creams are performing well, as people keep complimenting me on my appearance. my sister visits and keeps staring at my face. she says im looking younger and asks if ive had botox. i reassure her i havent  and still wouldnt. with only a few days left before my experiment ends, i realise how strange its going to be using just one cream on my whole face. i have become so used to patting one cream on one side and another cream on the other. but which one is going to be the winner? result the nivea cream performed better according to the scans . i return to nicolas for the final results and hes unequivocal. according to the dermatologists scans, nivea has performed best. he says the lefthand side of my face  where i used nivea  has retained better hydration than its rival. not only this, but my redness has reduced and some of the fine lines around my eyes have disappeared. on the nivea side, he thinks i have the skin of someone five years younger than i am. while i felt that both creams made my skin look great, if you can get better results for a fraction of the price of crme de la mer and a lot less hassle in the morning, the winner is obvious. so when a friend rings me from lidl to tell me nivea crme is on special offer  a 200ml pot is just 1.99  i ask her to buy me two.","alison steadman, 66, recently said she doesnt use expensive face creams . she, kate winslet and joan collins moisturise with nivea crme . can a potion that costs just over 1 really compete with a luxury brand?

"a girl of nine died in her fathers arms on christmas day just hours after a junior doctor wrongly sent her home, an inquest was told. rhianna rawding, who was born with kidney problems, was rushed to hospital after falling ill with a severe water infection. she was examined by a junior doctor but, despite being unable to walk or breathe properly and suffering purple blotches on freezing cold feet a possible symptom of septicaemia or blood poisoning rhianna was discharged and told to simply take antibiotics instead. rhianna lilly rawding died on christmas day after a junior doctor sent her home when he should have kept her in for observation . however, less than six hours later the youngster was dead. she suffered a massive heart attack and died of septicaemia at around 6.30am christmas morning. yesterday her parents, gemma and justin rawding, accused the nhs of gambling with their daughters life after a coroner said she should never have been sent home from hospital. mr rawding, 39, a forklift truck driver, said we certainly feel the doctors let her down, they could have done more. we felt something was very wrong and kept expressing our concerns, but they didnt want to know. i know that the nhs is pressed, i know that they can be understaffed but its not acceptable to say we cant have senior doctors examine patients. i feel like they were taking a gamble sending us home and they shouldnt be able to take shortcuts or put lives at risk. noone wants to be in hospital on christmas but i would rather have waited another two hours and made sure rhianna was seen by the right people. we feel that something could have been done if they had been monitoring her. gemma and justin rawdings said they were extremely reluctant to return home with their daughter on christmas eve last year . the tragedy for us is that we will never know what would have happened if she had stayed in hospital and not been sent home. mrs rawding, a support worker for adults with learning difficulties, added the whole family has been absolutely devastated by rhiannas death. we believe she would be alive today if she had had better care. rhianna, described as a bright, loving and funny little girl, was diagnosed with a duplex kidney aged 18 months. the relatively common condition meant she had two kidneys on her left side, but only one was working correctly, leaving her susceptible to regular urinary tract or water infections. the inquest, at southwark coroners court, was told that, despite her problems, rhianna, of medway, kent, lived a pretty normal life. but on saturday december 22 last year the schoolgirl began complaining of stomach ache, nausea and a headache. when she hadnt improved by christmas eve, her parents took her to the family gp, who confirmed she had a water infection and prescribed antibiotics. she was examined by a junior doctor at lewisham hospital but, despite being unable to walk or breathe properly and suffering purple blotches on freezing cold feet a possible symptom of septicaemia or blood poisoning rhianna was discharged . later that night, however, rhiannas condition worsened and she began struggling to breathe. her parents noticed purple blotches or bruising to her feet and decided to take her to lewisham hospital, where she was seen by junior doctor james connors at around 12.30am. the medic, who qualified four years earlier, but had been working in paediatric ae for just a month, said he didnt think to take the youngsters blood pressure. the test, the court heard, may have shown rihanna to have low blood pressure  a symptom often associated with blood poisoning. mr rawding added i told him wed never seen her as poorly as this before, we were concerned that it wasnt just a water infection. the doctor went to speak to a senior paediatrician but when he came back said the best thing was to discharge her and see if there was improvement within 48 hours. fighting back tears, he told the hearing we knew something wasnt right. i had never seen her like that. we left it to the professionals as we thought they knew best. dr tina sajjanhar, a more senior doctor at the hospital with 15 years experience, said she would most likely have admitted the youngster. rhianna  pictured on her first birthday  described as a bright, loving and funny little girl, was diagnosed with a duplex kidney aged 18 months . it is very difficult to disagree with the fathers view that rhianna should have been kept in for observation, she said.  we tell doctors to take parents concerns into consideration as they can be very astute. the couple returned home extremely reluctantly at around 2.30am but at 6.30am rhianna was still complaining of feeling cold, so mrs rawding went to run her a hot bath. as mr rawding picked up his daughter to take her to bathroom she suffered a massive heart attack and stopped breathing. rhianna once said to her father that when she died she wanted to come back as a beautiful butterfly. coroner dr phillip barlow refused an application by the hospital that rhianna died of natural causes . rhianna pictured last year. her parents, who are taking legal action against the hospital, tried to resuscitate her while waiting for an ambulance, but nothing could be done and she was pronounced dead two hours later . the couple, who are taking legal action against the hospital, tried to resuscitate her while waiting for an ambulance, but nothing could be done and she was pronounced dead two hours later. coroner dr phillip barlow refused an application by the hospital that rhianna died of natural causes. instead he delivered a narrative verdict, saying it seems to me that if she had been seen by a more experienced doctor she would probably have been kept in for observation and further deterioration would have become more apparent during the early hours of christmas morning and would have been acted on more quickly. however, the coroner stressed it was impossible for him to say on the balance of probabilities whether she would have survived. the couples solicitor, beth reay, of manchesterbased jmw solicitors, said the rawdings had lost everything they lived for. we are very concerned about the care provided to rhianna as some quite basic checks were not done, mrs reay said. it is also very worrying that her parents reported symptoms to hospital staff that indicated

"cnn  californias high court ruled thursday that retailers dont have the right to ask customers for their zip code while completing credit card transactions, saying that doing so violates a cardholders right to protect his or her personal information. many retailers in california and nationwide now ask people to give their zip code, punching in that information and recording it. yet california supreme courts seven justices unanimously determined that this practice goes too far. the ruling, penned by justice carlos moreno, overrules earlier decisions by trial and appeals courts in california. it points to a 1971 state law that prohibits businesses from asking credit cardholders for personal identification information that could be used to track them down. while a zip code isnt a full address, the courts judgment states that asking for it  and piecing that 5digit number together with other information, like a cardholders name  would permit retailers to obtain indirectly what they are clearly prohibited from obtaining directly, therefore endrunning the intent of california state laws. the legislature intended to provide robust consumer protections by prohibiting retailers from soliciting and recording information about the cardholder that is unnecessary to the credit card transaction, the decision states. we hold that personal identification information ... includes the cardholders zip code. bill dombrowski, president of the california retailers association, said it is ironic that a practice aimed partly at protecting consumers from fraud is being taken away. we think its a terrible decision because it dramatically expands what personal information is, by including a zip code as part of an address, dombrowski said. we are surprised by it. the court decision applies only in california, though it reflects a practice that is increasingly common elsewhere. it does not specify how or if all businesses that take credit cards, such as gas stations, would be affected  though it does state that its objection is not over a retailer seeing a persons zip code, but rather recording and using it for marketing purposes. the discussion began with a june 2008 classaction lawsuit filed initially by jessica pineda against home retailer williamssonoma. in her suit, pineda claimed that a cashier had asked for her zip code during a purchase  information that was recorded and later used, along with her name, to figure out her home address. williamssonoma did this tapping a database that it uses to market products to customers and sell its compiled consumer information to other businesses. pineda contended the practice of asking for zip codes violates a persons right to privacy, made illegal use of her personal information and gave a retailer, like williamssonoma, an unfair competitive advantage. williamssonoma claimed that a zip code doesnt constitute personal identification information, as stated in the 1971 state law. the state supreme court ruling, only addressing the identification information issue, determined that a zip code should be protected, since the law specifically mentions protecting a cardholders address. the court concluded requesting a zip code is not much different than asking for a phone number or home address. it is not illegal in california for a retailer to see a persons zip code or address, the ruling notes for instance, one can request a customers drivers license to verify his or her identity. what makes it wrong is when a business records that information, according to the ruling, especially when the practice is unnecessary to the sales transaction. in reversing the court of appeals judgment, the supreme court remanded the case back to a lower court to order specific changes and policies consistent with this decision.","california supreme court justices vote 70 to overturn two lower court decisions . the decision finds that a zip code is protected personal identification information the court objects to retailers using such info to track people down for marketing . the head of a retailers association says, we think its a terrible decision",23,645,3190,0.03565891472868217,4.945736434108527,57,240,645,54,23,3,3190,272,california high court rules retailers don't have the right to ask customers for their zip code. cnn's bill dombrowski says it is ironic that a practice aimed partly at protecting consumers from fraud is being taken away.
"new york cnn  nearly 13 years after terrorists hijacked four airliners, crashed them and killed almost 3,000 people, a museum dedicated to the day that changed america will open in new york. the national september 11 memorial museum will open to the general public on may 21, the museum and memorial group announced monday. the museum, located at the site of the original world trade center, will feature a core memorial exhibition that pays tribute to the 2,983 people killed in the september 11, 2001 attacks and in the february 26, 1993 bombing of the world trade center. a second historical exhibition, told through personal artifacts, photographs, audio and video footage and firstperson testimonials, will explore what led up to the terror strikes, examine the aftermath and illustrate how 911 continues to shape our world, according to a statement from the museum. when the museum opens to the public on may 21, millions will come to further understand the experiences, courageous actions, and terrible losses that we saw on 911 and in the aftermath. the museum will forever remind us of the capacity we have to come together when the times require, 911 memorial president joe daniels said. the official opening will be preceded by a five day, 24hour dedication period during which members of the 911 community will have exclusive access to the museum and memorial. during that time, family members of those lost on 911, rescue and recovery workers, active duty first responders from agencies that lost members in the attacks and survivors of the attacks  as well as lower manhattan residents and business owners  will be able to visit the memorial and museum when it is best for them, the release said. we are honored that the first people to experience this museum will be the men and women who came to our aid and protected us on 911, the families of the innocent victims killed that day, and the survivors who lived to tell the tale of an unimaginable horror so that we may learn from the past. the museum is built upon their incredible stories, 911 memorial chair and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg said. family members of those killed on that day will not have to pay admission to the museum, nor will rescue and recovery workers who are registered with the memorial. tickets for the general public will be available beginning march 26 on the museums website. the museum will also house a repository of the 8,000 sets of remains that have yet to be identified from the 911 attacks. the remains, which are in the custody of the office of the chief medical examiner, will be kept behind a wall in an area offlimits to the public, said 911 museum spokesman michael frazier. the museums website says the wall, which visitors will be able to view, will be inscribed with the words of roman poet virgil no day shall erase you from the memory of time. only medical examiners and victims families will be given access to the repository, where dna identifications of the unidentified remains will continue, according to representatives from the museum and the medical examiners office. the decision to house the remains in the museum repository has been controversial. in 2011, 17 families of 911 victims filed a petition in court to force the museum to consult with victims families before deciding what to do with the remains. they eventually asked for a congressional hearing. both efforts were unsuccessful. on its website, the museum said the decision to move the remains to the repository at the museum was due to the overwhelming feedback received from families after the attacks. you will never be able to please everyone. when it comes to human remains, we have to treat them with as much dignity and respect as they deserve, said lee ielpi, president and cofounder of 911 tribute center. ielpi lost his son, a 29yearold firefighter, on 911. now is the time to bring those remains back to where they have been murdered. when hijacked american airlines flight 11 and united airlines flight 175 were intentionally crashed into the north and south towers of the world trade center on 911, 2,753 people were killed. on the same day, another 224 people died when hijacked planes crashed into the pentagon and in a field outside shanksville, pennsylvania. a february 26, 1993 terror attack  also at the world trade center  left six people dead. cnns adrienne zulueta and chris kokenes contributed to this report.","the national 911 museum will open to the public on may 21 . a dedication period for families and community members

"a female fighter pilot yesterday led britains first combat mission against islamic state as the raf launched two waves of attack against the deadly terrorists. the unnamed officer piloted one of two heavilyarmed jets that flew from a topsecurity raf base in cyprus on the dangerous sortie over isheld territory in northern iraq, before returning safely to complete her 2,000mile round trip. the sortie, lasting several hours, was the first mission for the rafs operation shader against is militants. and last night two more tornado gr4 aircraft took off from the cyprus base, bound for northern iraq. scroll down for video . two of the raf crew, clad in mk14 suits with special gforce protection, carry flight equipment with them as they head out to fly over iscontrolled territory in iraq . the first day of gulf war three, the first british combat missions over iraq for six years, involved tornados bristling with sophisticated weaponry flying in support of iraqi troops engaging is terrorists in trench warfare below. defence sources conceded last night that neither of the tornados in the first wave engaged the enemy and both jets returned to raf akrotiri with their full payloads of rockets and ammunition intact highlighting growing concern over whether britain is pulling its weight in the coalition arrayed against is. female tornado pilots conducted hundreds of sorties over afghanistan as part of britains war against the taliban. in early 2010, flight lieutenant juliette fleming right described how she was repeatedly called upon to swoop down within 100ft of rocketwielding fanatics to disrupt their attacks on uk troops in helmand province. flt lieut fleming was based at raf marham, norfolk, where many of the air crew serving as part as operation shader are based. there are thought to be about ten female fighter pilots cleared to fly typhoon or tornado jets in combat missions for the raf. the americans by contrast, yesterday continued their heavy bombardment of key is strongholds around the city of raqqa, in northern syria, where it is believed british hostages alan henning and john cantlie are being held under threat of decapitation. the mail on sunday was invited to witness the first tornados taking off, as britain finally joined the international coalition taking offensive action against is, which has taken control of vast areas of northern iraq and syria. the mission remained the subject of secrecy last night as defence sources refused to disclose whether the raf pilots had flown in support of iraqi or kurdish fighters and whether the mission had been a success. the first mission was described as a routine operational sortie with air crews using new rules of engagement approved by parliament on friday for the first time. a defence source said the mission involved responding to a changing situation on the ground, with moving targets rather than static positions being on the agenda. the aircraft were equipped with weapon systems reflecting the operational requirements but on this occasion no rockets were fired. the two tornados then flew back to raf akrotiri and the crews went through their routine debriefing process. it is likely that further missions will take place in the days ahead. the mos understands that yesterdays first mission was conducted by no 2 squadron raf and followed a request for air support received on friday evening only a few hours after mps voted by an overwhelming majority of 524 votes to 43 to endorse attacks on the militants in iraq. the requirements of the specific mission were then pieced together overnight and into yesterday morning, with officers from the rafs 140 expeditionary air wing eaw, which deployed to cyprus last month, liaising with staff at permanent joint headquarters pjhq back in britain. then, at about 9.30am and in humid conditions at the base on cypruss southern coast, the chosen pilots and navigators emerged from a hangar and walked casually towards their aircraft. they spent almost an hour inspecting every inch of the tornados, checking for any fault which could compromise their safety. then the crews climbed twobytwo inside their aircraft, strapped themselves and lowered the canopies. until yesterday, their missions, though vital, had been benign. this was the first time they could have been called upon to extinguish human life. at around 10.30am, the tornados rolled onto the runway and, with a deafening howl of their rollsroyce engines, sped across the tarmac and ascended rapidly into the overcast eastern mediterranean skies. they were followed minutes later by a huge raf voyager refuelling aircraft, used to top up aviation gas supplies for the round trip to northern iraq. as a diplomatic courtesy to countries who do not wish to publicise their role in the coalition against is, defence sources declined to disclose the flight path taken by the aircraft as they flew to and from the battlefield. the pilots were guided over isheld territory by american flight planners. the involvement of a woman raf pilot comes after female pilot major mariam al mansouri of the uae was revealed to have flown an f16 jet in bombing raids against is positions in syria last week. yesterday, the us and other coalition countries again conducted air strikes against known is targets inside the enemys heartland of syria. defence experts have argued that the only way to defeat is is to target them where they are strongest but british forces remain restricted in where they may launch attacks against the jihadis. it was with great relief to all 2,500 military and civilian personnel stationed at raf akrotiri that the first pair of jets touched down safely at around 3.30pm local time yesterday. raf tornado gr4s at raf akrotiri cyprus being armed with the paveway iv laser guided bomb . ground crew load the tornados with a paveway iv precisionguided bomb above and right. the aircraft is famed for its ability to carry an extensive range and configuration

guided bombs, in support of operation shader . shortly afterwards, defence sources confirmed that neither aircraft undertook offensive action and that despite media attention the mission had been restricted to reconnaissance and intelligencegathering. an mod spokesman said royal air force tornado gr4 aircraft have been flying intelligence gathering missions over iraq for a number of weeks. today, following the parliamentary approval given yesterday, in company with other aircraft from the international coalition, two tornados conducted armed reconnaissance operations over areas of iraq where the terrorists threaten the civilian population. although on this occasion no targets were identified as requiring immediate air attack by our aircraft, the intelligence gathered by the tornados highly sophisticated surveillance equipment will be invaluable in developing the best possible understanding of isils disposition and help acquire potential targets for future operations. furthermore, we know that the very presence of coalition air power has a significant impact on isils efforts to attack the iraqi people. with no effective defence against air strikes, and knowing the precision with which coalition aircraft can hit them, the terrorists are forced to be much more cautious, keeping their forces dispersed and movement inhibited. a pair of tornado gr4 jets flew in support of iraqi troops engaging is terrorists in trench warfare below . they also know that should they concentrate to deliver an attack against iraqi or kurdish troops, aircraft are likely to arrive overhead very soon afterwards. news of the tornados first sorties came as the britishbased syrian observatory for human rights said that us air strikes in raqqa killed 23 is terrorists yesterday. there was fierce fighting between kurdish militia and the is fanatics for the town of kobani on the syriaturkey border, which has been besieged for the last ten days. most of the local population numbering about 150,000 people have poured into turkey as the is fighters battle for control of the strategically important area. dozens of is extremists continued to shell the town yesterday. crew of a british

"by . daniel martin, whitehall correspondent . mps should be sent on honesty classes to ensure they adhere to ethical standards while in public office, the sleaze watchdog said last night. the committee on standards in public life said all new mps must undergo an induction programme to drill into them the seven principles of public life. these principles, drawn up in the 1990s, state that all those in public office should abide by standards of selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. lord bew said ethics classes would be needed all the more if parliament passes a recall bill, under which members of the public would be able to expel an mp if they are deemed to have fallen short . the rules were drawn up following allegations that mps were receiving cash to ask questions in the house of commons. but they did not prevent scandals such as mps expenses, leading to fears that more needs to be done to instil into mps their responsibilities. the chairman of the committee, lord bew, said he was concerned that only small numbers of mps ever turned up at induction courses which are currently offered on ethical standards. after the last election in 2010, fewer than one in five new mps attended induction meetings, and one workshop on dealing with ethical dilemmas had to be cancelled due to poor takeup. lord bew said that all new mps should have to go on them. he said ethics classes would be needed all the more if parliament passes a recall bill, under which members of the public would be able to expel an mp if they are deemed to have fallen short. in his report, ethics in practice, lord bew also called for special advisers senior political aides to ministers to be sent on the courses. awareness and understanding of the seven principles of public life cannot be left to chance, he said. we need to make sure that all of those in public life are aware of their ethical responsibilities and are prepared to act as ethical leaders. the public expects nothing less. of particular concern to us was the reported lack of engagement with induction by large numbers of members of parliament. with the prospect of a recall bill, which will give the public the power to remove mps who have behaved in ways that fall short of the standards expected of them, the stakes have never been higher. the man in the white suit former independent mp martin bell thinks that mps should be forced to undergo classes in honesty . in effect, ethical issues will now be under even greater scrutiny. more than ever, mps need to be fully aware of the principles and the rules that guide their behaviour parliament and the political parties need to provide the opportunities for them to build that awareness and understanding. an induction programme that fully embraces ethical standards should be the first of those opportunities. the hansard society, a constitutional think tank, said officials estimated that just 19 per cent of new members had attended at least one session of the induction programme in 2010. attendance rarely rises above six mps at any one time, and one workshop on ethical dilemmas had to be cancelled altogether. some mps are against the induction classes, telling the hansard society the executive would like to train members of parliament. it absolutely mustnt happen. but former mp and bbc journalist martin bell said last night i think its a good idea. it doesnt have to be very long or complicated, but its a good way to make sure that they dont break the rules.","committee on standards in public life . said all new mps must undergo an induction programme to drill into them seven principles of public life these principles are selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty . and leadership . after the last election in 2010, fewer than one in five new mps attended induction meetings .",27,662,2917,0.04078549848942598,4.406344410876133,56,270,662,61,27,4,2917,295,"committee on standards in public life said all new mps must undergo an induction programme to drill into them the seven principles of public life. rules were drawn up following allegations that mps were receiving cash to ask questions in the house of commons. but they did not prevent scandals such as mps expenses, leading to fears that more needs to be done to instil into mps their responsibilities."

surgery for advice. grieving james given, left, is to sue the welsh ambulance service over the death of his wife gillian, right . the receptionist told him that dr jon evans would call at their home later that day, but advised him to dial 999 if mrs given needed urgent help. bosses of a gp outofhours service which fiddled its figures hundreds of times handed themselves huge bonuses, it has emerged. christopher hyman, chief executive of serco which is responsible for outofhours gp services in cornwall, was awarded the performancerelated sum of 812,250 on top of his 700,000 annual salary. a report by mps today reveals that last year the firm fiddled its figures on 252 separate occasions to cover up poor care. this data included the number of patients who were able to see a doctor as well as how long they were made to wait. the public accounts committee report reveals that the figures were made to look so good that another unnamed manager at serco was handed a bonus for his performance. it also accuses managers at serco of trying to root out whistleblowers who had raised concerns about poor care. at around 3pm mr given dialled 999, but when he asked for an ambulance his call was triaged and put through to mrs evans at the nhs direct call centre in swansea for assessment. nhs direct wales is part of the welsh ambulance services nhs trust. after asking the couple, who had been together for more than 30 years, a series of computerised questions mrs evans decided against sending an ambulance. when questioned by coroner john gittins, mrs evans admitted it was ultimately the computer and not the nurse who decided whether an ambulance should be dispatched. however, she said that, on occasion, she had not agreed with the computers findings. asked whether she had felt any gut instinct that an ambulance should have been called, mrs evans, who resigned soon after the tragedy, replied yes. stephanie kneath, a manager with nhs direct, said not enough questions had been asked of mrs given about the length of time she had been in pain and exactly where the pain was. asked by the coroner whether nurses could deviate from the computer programme, mrs kneath replied the system is to support their clinical knowledge. the inquest at ruthin town hall on tuesday was also told that the call centre was noisy at times which could stop nurses hearing responses clearly. mrs given died of severe atheroma a blockage most commonly caused by cholesterol deposits or swelling of the arteries and left ventricular failure. happier times mr and mrs given are pictured on their wedding day in 1998 . recording a verdict of death from natural causes, mr gittins said human error, which amounted to neglect, had played a part in mrs givens death. he added that he would be recommending the ambulance trust examine the working environment at the call centre to improve soundproofing. mrs given worked as a sister at the now closed cranage hall nhs hospital for the mentally ill in cheshire for 22 years before retiring in 1993. mr given said dr evans told the hearing its likely my wife would be here today if they had sent an ambulance. she could have had an injection to remove the blockage if she had been seen sooner, but the twohour delay proved fatal. however, the coroner said he doubted whether paramedics would have carried or been able to administer such an injection. mr given is suing the welsh ambulance service for compensation. a spokesman for the service said they extended their deepest sympathies to the family and would be reviewing their arrangements for keeping noise to a minimum in their centres. mistakes deputy coroner john gittens said that human error played a part in the death of mrs givens .","gillian given, 58, called 999

"cnn  in a letter to the ncaa disclosed wednesday, the justice department said it has received several requests for an antitrust investigation into the current bowl championship series system, and it wants information to help it decide what to do. that controversial system makes it very difficult for teams in some athletic conferences to qualify for major bowl games, potentially costing millions of dollars in revenue to those not chosen. serious questions continue to arise suggesting that the current bcs system may not be conducted consistent with the competition principles expressed in federal antitrust laws, assistant attorney general christine varney told ncaa president mark emmert. the decision to release the letter came hours after sen. orrin hatch, rutah, a major opponent of the current system, demanded further consideration of the issue in a facetoface appearance with attorney general eric holder at a senate judiciary committee hearing. holder responded by disclosing the justice department had sent a letter to the ncaa on the issue tuesday. in her letter, varney asked emmert to explain why college football does not have a playoff when so many other college sports do. she also asked what steps, if any, the ncaa has taken to create a playoff, and whether the ncaa has determined that there are aspects of the bcs system that do not serve interests of fans, colleges, universities, and players. officials acknowledge the ncaa is not legally required to respond, although lawyers following the case expect the association to do so. antitrust lawyers have been watching the debate grow for more than two years, to see whether the justice department will jump into the case. one antitrust expert who declares himself neutral in the case says he doubts justice will launch a probe because it has a full plate of more pressing issues. there is a problem, but not an antitrust problem, said gordon schnell of the new york firm constantine cannon. a court could never require a football playoff, but they could break up the current bcs system, he said. currently, the bcs system limits automatic bids to the winners of the big ten, big east, big 12, atlantic coast conference, pac 10 and the southeast conference, thereby leaving out other conferences, including almost all schools in the rocky mountain region. only two remaining atlarge spots are available to all other colleges and universities. cnns terry frieden contributed to this report .",the bowl championship series system makes it hard for some college teams to qualify . millions of dollars in revenue are at stake in the football bowl selection process . assistant attorney general varney seeks an explanation .,15,441,2062,0.034013605442176874,4.675736961451247,43,163,441,38,15,3,2062,190,"the justice department has received several requests for an antitrust investigation. the current bowl championship series system makes it very difficult for teams in some athletic conferences to qualify for major bowl games. the bcs system limits automatic bids to the winners of the big ten, big east, big 12 and southeast conference."

"cnn  let me tell you about the amazing kid who lives in our house. shes 6 and she is the most hysterical, sarcastic, intelligent, funny, sweet, nave, confident, strong, independent, considerate person i have ever met. i have no idea how she got to be this way. you see, my husband is a quadriplegic. i care for him, i work fulltime, and there are days when i feel like our daughter gets very little of my attention. isabel was 6 months old when her dad was injured. during her first six months, he was just ok at changing diapers and he had no fashion sense when it came to dressing her. but he loved feeding her and playing with her and those two spent tons of time together. then, our lives changed. it was december 21, 2007, three days before isabels first christmas. at our annual christmas party with our friends, around midnight, my husband decided to jump into the snow to make a snow angel. why? because hes ben. i remember looking at him, smiling and shaking my head. he looked at me, grinned and ran out into the snow  and never got up. he had broken his neck at the c4c5 level and was paralyzed completely from the shoulders down. i do not remember my daughters first christmas. my parents and sisters spent it with her while i was in the hospital with my husband. i went from hugging and snuggling her before the accident to barely being able to look at her without crying. i couldnt even hold her because the responsibility of being a single parent in the physical sense was so overwhelming, i shut down. every single minute of the day, i begged someone to fix my husband. i remember one night in the icu, the nurses got a rocker for me from the nicu and made me sit with isabel in bens room. it was like they knew we needed time together, just the two of us. it felt very foreign to me for a very long time. i felt like her babysitter, not her mom. while i rocked her, i stared at her wondering how we were going to manage as a family and how unfair it was to her that we were putting her through so much. my mom became isabels surrogate parent for almost eight months because i needed to focus on my husband. she was the one who got up with our daughter when she cried, and brought her to visit in rehab. looking back, it still hurts to know how much time i missed with my daughter. i missed her first steps. i missed her first words. i missed so much. and it took years until i could let that all go, until i felt like her mom again. im finally realizing how hard it must have been on my husband. he was no longer able to hold her. to help her. to play with her. he had to watch from the sidelines while everyone else took care of his child. as new parents, you expect things to be difficult. but when dealing with a spinal cord injury, difficult doesnt begin to describe it. i went from caring for a 6monthold with my husband to caring for a 6monthold and my husband. i liked how things were before the injury. my strong, confident husband took charge and i followed. in a second, it changed. i had to be responsible for our family. i am always the first one up and the last one to bed. i am pushed to the limit physically, emotionally and mentally almost every single day. but it has made us stronger. as we learned how to live our new life, things became easier. we developed a routine. we found our sense of humor again. we worried about the relationship between ben and isabel. a lot. every time she said that she didnt like him or want him around, we worried that it was because of his injury. we made a big deal out of it. we stressed about it. we talked to her teachers about it. we talked to a counselor about it. we thought that our daughter wouldnt connect with her dad because of his injury. it turns out we were wrong. very wrong. isabel is your typical 6yearold who just happens to have learned more about life than most ever do, one who will place her hands on my face and solemnly tell me, everything will be ok. our daughter loves her daddy. she knows hes disabled. she knows he broke his neck. she knows there are limitations to what they can do together but trust me, they push the boundaries every single day. more than once, shes come running to tell me that daddy got stuck in the mud or fell forward in his wheelchair or ran out of battery while on a walk. shes come to me crying because she bumped her head or arm falling from her daddys chair when she was climbing on it, or riding in his lap, or jumping onto the couch from his chair. too many times ive had to yell at both of them for chasing each other through the house he in his chair and she on her scooter. too many times ive had to tell them to stop it because they were about to get into trouble together. shes figured out the best way to crawl into his lap to watch a movie. she climbs onto the counter so she can give him a kiss at night. she turns off his chair when hes in her room at night so he has to stay while she falls asleep. she puts clips in his hair and puts makeup on him to play dress up. she rolls her eyes when ben tells a terrible joke and thinks its hilarious when she tries to tickle him, even though he cannot feel it. isabel doesnt see ben as a quadriplegic. she sees him as her father. she goes to him when shes sad. she celebrates with him when shes happy. his injury does not define their relationship. their love for each other does. every day i get to see that love they share grow into something even bigger. she has taught me how to look past her dads disability to see him for who he really is my husband. the man i married. the man i love. that little kid has taught me more about love and life in her six years than anyone ever could. she taught us how to laugh again. how to have fun again. how to love each other again. she was the one who taught us that life was worth living. i cannot wait to see else what else she can teach us as she grows.","erin hayes husband broke his neck on december 21, 2007 .

france and britain. in june 1940 the polish government in exile formed a polish air force in the uk, with two fighter squadrons  302 and 303  composed of polish pilots and ground crews, with british commanding officers. the two fighter squadrons went into action in august. most of the polish pilots had hundreds of hours of prewar flying experience and were among the most experienced in the battle. they had learned from combat experience to fire from close range. between them the polish pilots claimed 201 aircraft shot down. 303 squadron, in which brigadier general tadeusz sawicz served, claimed the highest number of kills  126  of all allied squadrons in the battle of britain. the polish war memorial on the outskirts of raf northolt was dedicated in 1948 as a commemoration of the polish contribution to allied arms. lt rogers continued to serve in bomber command flying lancasters, until his retirement from the raf in 1948. his service log books highlight 12,000 flying hours in

the auster to spot terrorist activity in the malayan jungle so that the ground troops could move in and flush them out. lt rogers won the raf air crew europe star, the defence medal and the highest accolade of polish medals, the virtuti militari. gordon commented in later life tony would always be guest of honour at battle of britain memorial dinners at raf brize norton, and sit at the top table with the commanding officer. he also met the duke of kent in 2002 at fairford air tattoo, and last year met the queen in london at the unveiling of the bomber command memorial. lt rogers was

"washington cnn  the obama administration is lifting the moratorium on deepwater oil drilling  put in place after the gulf oil spill disaster  for operators who comply with tough new rules and regulations, interior secretary ken salazar announced tuesday. there will always be risks associated with deepwater drilling, salazar said. we have reached a point where we have significantly reduced those risks. the sixmonth moratorium was first issued by salazar in may after the april 20 explosion of bps deepwater horizon drilling rig in the gulf of mexico that killed 11 people and triggered one of the worst environmental disasters in u.s. history. an estimated 4.9 million barrels 206 million gallons of oil gushed into the gulf before the broken well, 5,000 feet below the surface, was capped. salazars initial moratorium was overturned by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by an appeals court. the interior secretary then issued a second ban in june that was scheduled to expire in november. critics of the ban, including republican leaders, gulf state officials and gulf coast residents, said it would only hurt oil and gas workers in the already hardhit coastal communities, where hundreds of jobs were lost because of the disaster. environmental groups and other supporters of the moratorium argued it was necessary due to a lack of effective regulation of deepwater drilling that allowed the deepwater horizon explosion and subsequent spill to occur. tuesdays decision came three weeks before congressional elections in which democrats are expected to lose seats in both chambers, and possibly lose control of the house. asked if the move was politically motivated to help gulf state candidates in tough races, white house press secretary robert gibbs said it was based on the completion of a proper policy review. this is a very deliberative policy process, gibbs said. it puts in place some important safety steps to ensure that when it is done again, it is done safely. salazar said the moratorium provided time to make sure similar accidents involving a failed piece of equipment called a blowout preventer wouldnt occur, and that rig operators were prepared to deal with worstcase scenarios if it did happen. under the new requirements, operators must show that their proposed development and exploration plans can deal with potential blowouts and undergo detailed inspections and design reviews of blowout preventers by independent third parties, said michael bromwich, the new head of the federal agency that oversees offshore oil drilling. bromwich said it might take time for companies to come into full compliance, but he expected some permits for resumed drilling to be approved by the end of the year. we will not approve permits without vital supplemental information required by the rules, said bromwich, director of the bureau of ocean energy management, regulation and enforcement. democratic sen. mary landrieu of louisiana, a critic of the moratorium, called tuesdays announcement a good first step but said more was needed to help the regions oil and gas industry get back to work. this means that the administration must continue to accelerate the granting of permits in shallow and deep water, and provide greater certainty about the rules and regulations industry must meet, landrieu said in a statement. landrieu has blocked senate consideration of president barack obamas nomination of jacob lew to become the new director of the white house office of management and budget to protest the moratorium. her statement said she would study the situation in coming weeks before deciding whether to lift her hold on the nomination when the senate returns from recess after the november 2 congressional elections. gibbs told reporters that the lew nomination was unrelated to the oil spill issue and he criticized landrieu for playing politics. we have said from the beginning that the hold was unwarranted and outrageous, he said. the chairman of the house energy and environment subcommittee, democratic rep. edward markey of massachusetts, praised the moratorium as a necessary step to instill safety in the drilling industry. this deepwater drilling suspension was always about keeping the gulf workers and waters safe from another oil spill, and it has been effective in doing so, markey said in a statement. the new rules that the interior department has issued will help ensure that if oil companies are going to drill ultradeep, they are doing so in a manner that is ultrasafe. environmental groups questioned if enough had been done to prevent another rig explosion and spills like the one that took oil giant bp and the government months to contain. todays actions are premature, said a statement from peter lehner, executive director of the natural resources defense council. the difficult cleanup process in the gulf has taught us prevention is key. to ensure a disaster like this never happens again, we must know what caused it in the first place. were still waiting for that answer and until we get it  the moratorium should remain in place. david guest, an attorney for earthjustice, said it was surprising the federal government thinks it has so quickly resolved all the problems that contributed to the spill. we learned from this spill that we have only a tiny fraction of whats necessary to control deep water oil spills, guest said in a statement. while weve now got some new regulations that address technology and safety, the federal government still hasnt come up with any new regulations addressing oil spill response. we still dont have the equipment or technology to control or contain the oil from a major blowout in the gulf. however, republican gov. bobby jindal of louisiana said the moratorium should have been lifted sooner, and that he now worried that severe bottlenecks in the federal permit review process have resulted in a de facto moratorium for shallow water drilling, the moratorium affected 36 operators, half of which were able to continue some level of work such as helping to dig relief tunnels that capped the broken well, salazar said. lifting the moratorium means applications for 18 exploratory wells can again move forward, providing they comply with the tougher new regulations and rules, he said. the policy position weve articulated today is that were open for business, salazar said. we will be taking applications for drilling in the deep water and well be processing those applications under the road map ... created in the last six months. cnns chief national correspondent

discovery producer thom beers admits i cant deny there was a degree of exploitation. mary as she was when phil fell for her  an exotic dancer at nightclub, goodtime charleys, wearing a gold nugget necklace given to her by her soontobe husband . but they were never going to let the deadliest catch just slip away. it had proved the unexpected hit of the discovery channel when it first aired in 2005, drawing an audience of 4 million without any promotion. the episode showing harriss death was the third highest rated airing of any show in the networks history. it had been a lucky spot having only ever been intended as a twelveminute segment in a twohour special, extreme alaska. and the phenomenal success was down to harris a different breed of man, according to show producer beers. he was a man with the deadliest job in the world and the deadliest lifestyle. in short, a man who lived high on borrowed time. harris suffered a massive stroke while offloading crab in port at saint paul island, alaska, on 29 january 2010. he survived another month before dying in hospital of a pulmonary embolism at the age of 53. both josh and jake harris fished with their father on the cornelia marie. it was josh who discovered his father following his stroke aboard the boat that made him famous. the once powerful man was contorted and twisted on the floor of his cabin, trapped under a hundred pound bench that had been bolted to the wall by the side of his bed. his last act of strength had been to rip that bench from its place. the man who had prided himself on his physical prowess after a lifetime spent at sea, in conditions few could endure, was paralysed down his left side. as he was strapped to a backboard and winched form his boat to the hospital bed that would prove his deathbed, producer thom beer now admits he faced a moral and professional dilemma. our cameras were there when they opened up his skull...oh my god, it was so tough, deadliest catch producer, thom

admire. but, as beers reflects we werent just interlopers who were going to walk in and say, hey youre dying. can we film it? in the end it was harris himself who took control, the last time he would do so. while the producers spoke with his sons and agonised over what to do and the star of the hit show lay dying, harris gestured for paper and pen. he couldnt speak but he could write and so he did youve got to finish the story, he wrote. it needs an ending. lovers phil and mary in the early days of the affair that led to the turbulent marriage that produced sons jake and josh . feckless phil with infant son josh but fatherhood could not curb his addictions to drink, drugs, gambling and women . that ending was his own. as medics performed surgery the prolonged harriss life by a few weeks, beers recalls our cameras were there when they opened up his skull. oh my god, it was so tough. harriss story began five decades earlier. he was raised by his father, grant a stoic fisherman from seattle, after his mother died of skin cancer. she was just 27, her son only eight. as harriss own son, jake, reflects my grandpa didnt know how to raise a kid. so he raised a worker. harris was working on his fathers boat while his peers played ball and were cossetted at home. grant harris tried to be a good father according to his grandsons josh and jake. stepmommy dearest phils second wife teresa whom sons josh and jake knew simply as satan but with his wife dead and the need to hold down several jobs to provide for his son, harris had plenty of opportunity to run wild. and he did. harris was voted least likely to succeed on graduation from high school and seemed determined to fulfil that destiny for much of his early teens. he left home at 15. he tore around town on his motorbike, got into trouble with the law, drank, smoked, partied and finally, for want of anything else to do, returned to the only the thing her knew, working for free on board a crabber. his job was to clean bait and his nickname was dirt because of his lack of personal hygiene. still, harris proved himself a worthy crew member and with status and catches came money. with money came vices or at least, for harris, the funds to indulge them. much of this biography reads more like that of a rock star than a fisherman from bothell, wa. at times it is all more redolent of rolling stone, keith harris than crabber captain phil. according to josh my dad once told me that when he was a young crab fisherman, hed get a big fat pay check, buy huge amounts of cocainerent the penthouse of a nice hotel, and rotate the girls in and out. thats how he lived his life for a long time. hed get a check for 80,000 but after three weeks it was gone. he admits pharmaceutical quality peruvian flake cocaine and highgrade strains of cannabis were the way phil rolled. one of the last images taken of phil a man who lived high on borrowed time . addicted to speed phil with nascar driver david reutimann, left, at phoenix international raceway in november 2008, loved fast cars, fast bikes and loose women all his life . harris was a prodigious gambler who . could go through 300 of chips in three seconds. he fell madly in love . with first wife mary an unhappily married, mother of two working as a . dancer in a grotty club when they met but neither she nor the birth of . their own children could keep him on the straight and narrow. though he went for periods relatively sober and apparently faithful to mary, their nine year marriage was characterised by a cruel mutual infidelity a tit for tat game in which there could be no true winner. drunk and high he once rode his harley davidson straight into the front room of the couples home. he crashed cars and he wrecked marriages his own and those of others. legend harris could pound a gallon of vodka, without drawing breath . this was a man who could pound down a gallon of vodka without taking a breath, before breakfast. years at sea in the company of russian sailors had given him an insatiable taste for stolichnaya vodka. in 1991 after nine years of marriage and 14 years together mary and harris divorced. he fought for custody of their sons and, remarkably, won. two years later he remarried. jake and josh make no secret of the contempt in which they held their stepmother, teresa. in a shocking section of the book josh describes her as an evil creature, and admits that he and his brother referred to her as satan. they claim that she beat them and drove their father to depression. the couple divorced in 2003 after ten years of marriage and when teresa died of a heart attack in 2011 josh state i didnt feel bad. she was one of the meanest people i ever met. shortly before his death harris asked his first wife, mary, to marry him again. she turned him down, telling him he was a much better friend than a husband. truth be known the man who emerges from the pages of this book seems a much easier person to watch than to know. he was wore his vices like virtues and remained an unreformed, unapologetic addict and wild man to the end. captain phil harris the legendary crab fisherman, our hero,

"the church of england is to allow full funerals for the first time to people who die by suicide. the decision sweeps away ecclesiastical laws which for centuries have said suicide is sinful and those who die by their own hand must be denied the complete rites of christian burial. the churchs parliament, the general synod, voted overwhelmingly yesterday to end the ban on funerals for suicides to signal its compassion for the vulnerable. synod members also heard that many clergy do give burial services to suicides and have done so for years despite the letter of church law. members of the general synod pictured voted by 262 to five to allow a full burial for those who have committed suicide. the practice is thought to be widespread already, despite church law forbidding it . church officials said the reform will bring the cofe into line with the 1961 suicide act, which abolished the idea that committing suicide was a crime. however the move comes at a time of growing political pressure for the legalisation of assisted suicide to allow the desperately disabled or dying help to take their own lives. the declaration of a new liberal church attitude to suicide is likely to be taken as encouragement by activists pushing for the repeal of the 1961 law, which sets down a maximum 14 year jail sentence for anyone who aids and abets a suicide. the churchs founding book of common prayer, which dates from the 16th century, says that the funeral service may not be used for any that die unbaptized, or excommunicate, or have laid violent hands upon themselves. suicides were often buried outside a consecrated churchyard or on the north side of the church, without the benefit of the prayer book burial service. current church law says that a specially adapted funeral service must be used in the case of anyone who has killed themselves who was of sound mind. however, few bishops have ever produced such services for their clergy to use. gloucester vicar canon michael parsons told the synod we take funerals of murderers, rapists, child abusers and gangsters and we are happy to commit them to mercy of god. but not, it seems, suicides. cast out in the past those who died by suicide were either buried on unconsecrated ground, or on the north side of a church, without a common book of prayer service file image he said most clergy disregard the law or are surprised to find they are conducting funerals that break the rules. passing this motion will be seen as hugely positive pastoral step. do we want to be part of church that rejects vulnerable people? he said. canon parsons added in a paper for the synod that the church law may lie behind a widespread public perception that suicide is the unforgiveable sin and hence the church will disapprove. there are public memories of real or imagined church hostility. yet pastoral practice has for many years been much more sympathetic and the vast majority of clergy today would wish to minister to the family in every way possible. the cofe has long abandoned any official disapproval of suicide. as long ago as 1959 a church report said that a person who attempts suicide must be in a state of mental distress and therefore needs special sympathy and understanding. the synod voted to change church law by 262 votes to five, with six abstentions. senior clergy and officials will now consider how to change the rules. they will also consider whether to allow full funerals for people who have not been baptised. an assisted suicide law which would allow terminally ill people with six months to live the right to deadly drugs, as long as they are of sound mind and settled on their wish to die, is currently being considered in the house of lords. some senior judges have indicated they are in favour of allowing the desperately ill to get help to kill themselves.",general synod votes 262 to five in favour of changing suicide rules . burials for those who commit suicide already though to be widespread . comes at a time when campaigners are pushing for right to die laws .,29,714,3164,0.04061624649859944,4.431372549019608,49,288,714,39,29,3,3164,171,"the general synod voted by 262 to five to allow a full burial for suicides. the practice is thought to be widespread already, despite church law forbidding it. it comes at a time of growing political pressure for the legalisation of assisted suicide to allow desperately disabled or dying help to take their own lives."

"by . jonathan ocallaghan . as apple fans obsess over what the iphone 6 is expected to look like, the rumour mill about the firms next range of tablets is slowly gaining traction. according to reports from korea, suppliers are gearing up to begin production of the nextgeneration ipad air  dubbed ipad air 2  later this month. it is expected to feature the 8mp camera seen on the iphone 5s, a faster processor and, most notably, it could sport apples fingerprint scanner to unlock the device. along with the improved security features promised on ios 8, this could make the ipad air 2 the most secure tablet ever. the original ipad air was launched on friday 1 november 2013 stock image shown. given apples preference for launching products on a friday, a release date for the upgraded ipad air 2 of 31 october 2014 seems possible, with the company apparently gearing up for a release in q3 or q4 this year . in addition to the rumoured fingerprint scanner, apples ios 8 could also help boost the security of its nextgeneration devices. for example, when connecting to a wifi network, the software wont reveal your devices mac address. this is used to identify the device, and can be used to determine who owns it. apple is also increasing privacy and payment controls in the app store. the tech giant is additionally paying closer attention to the types of apps it approves on its store to avoid developers spamming customers, or showing excessive advertising. according to macrumors, production of the displays for the nextgeneration tablet has begun. this will gear it up for release in the autumn, expected to be a friday towards the end of october, bringing it in line with previous releases. the original ipad air, for example, launched on friday 1 november 2013  perhaps suggest 31 october 2014 could be a favoured date for the latest release, given apples preference of launching products on a friday. the ipad air 2 is rumoured to have the same screen size as its predecessor, which sported a 9.7inch 24.6 centimetres retina lcd display that had a resolution of 2048 x 1536. it could also have a similar thickness, of 0.3 inches 7.5mm and a similar weight of around 16.6 oz 470g. its thought the camera will be upgraded from the 5mp version seen on the current ipad air to the same 8mp camera used on the iphone 5s. this could also include the isight technology that makes lowlight shots easier to take, and allows for slowmotion video to be filmed. californiabased apple inc stock image shown is gearing up to release the latest version of its ipad air later this year. rumours suggest the air 2 will have an faster processor and a better camera than its predecessor. the overall size of the tablet, however, is likely to remain nearly the same . apples iphone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim air version that will make it the slimmest phone in the world. up until august last year, huawei was the recordholder for the thinnest phone in the world with its ascend p6, at 0.24 inches 6.18 millimetres. this was then replaced by the vivo x3 at just 0.23 inches 5.75 millimetres. by comparison, apples current iphone 5s has a depth of 0.3 inches 7.6 millimetres, while the ipad air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches 7.5 millimetres. samsungs galaxy s5 is 0.3 inches 7.6 millimetres thick, while the htc one m8 is 0.37 inches 9.35 millimetres. inside the device, the tablet is expected to sport a new and improved processor in the form of the a8, with among tech reporting this will have 50 per cent more performance than the previous a7. and finally, it is almost certain the air 2 will use the same touch id fingerprint sensor to unlock the device. this was introduced on the iphone 5s and is expected to also be used on the iphone 6. a new ipad mini is also expected to be released at the same time as apples other flagship models. apple . sees its touch id fingerprint scanner as the future of digital security, and . with ios 8 on the horizon, apple is opening up that technology to app developers, stephen ashby from icreate magazine tells mailonline. the ipad air 2 will not only be more secure, but it will also make it easier . for users to sign into online accounts or buy things safely and quickly. its . unlikely that apple will change its winning formula too much, though. apples iphone 5s pictured was the first phone from the tech giant to

brun, according to the daily telegraph. the video was posted on the facebook page of britishtrained doctor niazi habash, who treated some of the aleppo victims. he said that they displayed symptoms of chemical exposure including foaming at the mouth, constricted pupils and difficulty breathing. warning president bashar alassad had been warned by western leaders that using chemical weapons would be crossing a red line they were treated using chemical weapons antidote atropine, dr habash claims. experts claim that their injuries appear to be similar to those suffered by victims of an attack on khan alassad, near aleppo. in the april 13 assault, 15 people were injured. fourmonthold yehia, 18monthold abu bakr younis and adult ghadeer neddaf all died from their injuries. the most likely chemical to have been used is sarin according to former british army specialist and director hamish de brettongordon. he told the telegraph from what weve seen and the descriptions of the containers being dropped from the air, it certainly seems that the regime is using sarin in an unprepared state in these attacks. but, as in the tokyo subway bombings, sarin does not need to be weaponised and placed in missiles to kill. it is still lethal when people are exposed to it. us president barack obama and western leaders had warned bashar alassad that using chemical weapons would be crossing a red line. but the latest claim that such weapons have been deployed by the regime is the fourth in recent months. uk foreign secretary william hague revealed last week that a soil sample taken from khan alassad had tested positive for a chemical agent. devastating 15 people were injured and three people killed in the assault on the sheikh massoud area on april 13 . victim a woman is treated for

rebels and said that both britain and france want to be able to take urgent action should future atrocities take place. the uk will send 34 vehicles, including five armoured 4x4s and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator bashar alassad. but critics warned that arming the rebels will be especially problematic because many opposition groups have been hijacked by al qaeda supporters. the obama administration opposes directly arming syrian opposition fighters, in part out of fear that the weapons could fall into the hands of islamic extremists. and syrias president alassad warned the west will pay a price in the heart of europe and the u.s. for their alleged backing islamic fundamentalists in his countrys civil war. deadly three people, including two children are said to have been killed in the attack on april 13, 15 more were injured . the european unions security chief has also warned today that young europeans fighting alongside rebels to bring down president assad, will be radicalised and could pose a serious threat to national security when they return home. it is feared some will become members of groups with links to alqaeda before launching terror attacks at home. syria is thought by the cia to have a large stockpile of chemical weapons and both the rebels and assads regime have accused each other of using them. fears have grown in recent months for the safety of the stockpile, thought to include sarin and mustard gas that can be deployed using aircraft, ballistic missiles and artillery rocket. it is also believed that syria has attempted to develop more toxic nerve agents. sarin is a more sophisticated successor to zyklon b which was used by the nazis in the extermination of millions of jews in hitlers death camps. it is like some farm pesticides but does not occur naturally and cannot occur naturally. saddam hussein used it in the late 80s against kurdish rebels and it was behind the death of the entire population of

"the search for missing malaysia airlines flight 370 resumed friday in the southern indian ocean with longrange reconnaissance aircraft looking for possible debris from the jetliner in one of the most remote locations on earth. aircraft from australia and the united states have staggered departures to an area roughly 1,500 miles southwest of perth, where two objects were captured on satellite and described as possible pieces of the plane, according to the australian maritime safety authority. the first plane, an australian air force p3 orion, arrived in the search area early afternoon local time, the authority said. given the distance from australia to where the objects were spotted by a commercial satellite, the aircraft will only have between two and three hours to traverse the search area before having to start the return journey, the maritime authority said. calling it the best lead so far to the whereabouts of the airliner that vanished 14 days ago with 239 passengers and crew, malaysia interim transportation secretary hishammuddin hussein told reporters the find gives us hope. as long as theres hope, we will continue, he said. along with the aircraft, a motley collection of merchant ships are heading to the search area, where they will join a massive norwegian cargo ship diverted to the area thursday at the request of australia. the sailors aboard the norwegian ship worked throughout the night looking for the objects, said erik gierchsky, a spokesman for the norwegian shipowners association. all men are on deck to continue the search, he told cnn. they are using lights and binoculars. authorities were hoping for better results after poor weather hindered thursdays search for the debris. even before suspending the search thursday night, authorities cautioned the objects could be something other than plane wreckage, such as shipping containers that had fallen off a passing vessel. australian prime minister tony abbott announced the news to the world in a statement in parliament. officials then gave more details in a briefing closely watched by relatives of some of the missing. for the loved ones of the passengers and crew aboard the flight, the news of the possible find first announced by australian was met with mixed reactions. it strikes me as just one more lead that may or may not come true, sarah bajc, whose fiance, american philip wood, was aboard the plane, told cnn. so its enough to make us all anxious again after a couple of days of quiet, but, you know, im cautiously pessimistic that its not a piece of the plane.  new theories about disappearance . the objects . satellites captured images of the objects about 14 miles 23 kilometers from each other and about 1,500 miles 2,400 kilometers southwest of australias west coast. the area is a remote, rarely traveled expanse of ocean far from commercial shipping lanes. the commercial satellite images, taken sunday, show two indistinct objects of reasonable size, with the largest about 24 meters 79 feet across, said john young, general manager of emergency response for the australian maritime agency. they appear to be awash with water and bobbing up and down, young said at the news briefing thursday. the objects could be from the plane, but they could be also something else  like a shipping container  caught in swirling currents known for creating garbage patches in the open ocean, he said. it is probably the best lead we have right now, young said. but we need to get there, find them, see them, assess them to know whether its really meaningful or not. it took four days for the images to reach the authority due to the volume of imagery being searched, and the detailed process of analysis that followed, the agency said in a prepared statement. the size of the objects concerned david gallo, one of the leaders of the search for air france flight 447, which crashed in the atlantic ocean in 2009. its a big piece of aircraft to have survived something like this, he said, adding that if it is from the aircraft, it could be part of the tail. the tail height of a boeing 777, the model of the missing malaysian plane, is 60 feet. mary schiavo, a cnn aviation analyst and former inspector general for the u.s. department of transportation, said she believes the australian prime minister would not have announced the find if officials werent fairly sure of what they had discovered. there have been so many false leads and so many starts and changes and then backtracking in the investigation, she said. he wouldnt have come forward and said if they werent fairly certain. although the overall search area spans a huge expanse of 3 million square miles, u.s. officials have been insistent in recent days that the aircraft is likely to be found somewhere in the southern indian ocean. if this is debris, what happens next? wide search continues . until searchers make a confirmed find of debris from the aircraft, the search and rescue operation will continue throughout the search zone, hishammuddin said. even as the focus shifted to the southern indian ocean, hishammuddin said malaysia was sending two aircraft to search kazakhstan in central asia. thats one of the locations along a northern corridor described as a possible location for the aircraft based on satellite pings sent by the plane after air traffic controllers lost contact with it in the early hours of march 8. cambodia, laos, thailand and china were searching their territories, hishammuddin said. india said thursday it is searching in the bay of bengal and the andaman sea, sending four warships and three aircraft to scour the region. that area is far north of the region where australian forces were leading the search for the photographed objects, but in an area previously identified as a possible crash site for the plane. meanwhile, 18 ships, 29 aircraft and six helicopters were taking part in the search in the southern corridor, where search efforts were intensifying in the area around the australian satellite find. in addition to the norwegian car carrier hegh st. petersburg, which arrived in the area thursday afternoon, a second merchant ship was expected to arrive friday night. the australian naval vessel hmas success is steaming to the site but remains some days away, hishammuddin said. china plans to send its icebreaker and research vessel xue long, or snow dragon, which is currently anchored in perth, chinas staterun xinhua news agency reported. the icebreaker will take four or five days to reach the search zone, according to the news agency. malaysias navy has six ships with three helicopters heading to the southern indian ocean to take part in the search, a malaysian government official said. other angles . although much attention was focused on the ocean search, investigators continue to follow other leads in the planes disappearance. among the many theories put forth since the planes disappearance is that one or both of the pilots were responsible in some way for the aircrafts disappearance, especially in light of revelations that appear to show that a sharp, unplanned turn in the flight path had been programmed into the planes flight management system before one of the pilots gave a routine signoff to malaysian air traffic controllers. on thursday, a u.s. official familiar with the investigation told cnn that an fbi team is confident that it will be able to retrieve at least some files deleted from the hard drive of a flight simulator owned by flight 370 capt. zaharie ahmad shah. investigators will also analyze websites that zaharie and copilot fariq ab hamid may have visited recently, the official said on the condition of anonymity. witnesses claim they saw plane . live latest updates on the missing malaysia airlines jetliner . if this is the debris of malaysia airlines flight 370, what happens next?

"an invisible shield, some 7,200 miles 11,600 km above earth, has been found blocking killer electrons from bombarding our planet. these electrons can whip around the planet at nearlight speed and have been known to threaten astronauts, fry satellites and damage space systems. if they hit earth on a large scale, they could knock out power grids, radically change the planets climate and drive up rates of cancer. the shield was discovered in the van allen radiation belts  two doughnutshaped rings above earth that are filled with highenergy electrons and protons . but while scientists know this mysterious shield exists, they are baffled as to how it formed and how exactly it works. somewhat like the shields created by force fields on star trek that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons, said professor daniel baker from the university of colorado boulder. the shield was discovered in the van allen radiation belts  two doughnutshaped rings above earth that are filled with highenergy electrons and protons. held in place by earths magnetic field, the van allen radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun. they were discovered in 1958 and are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles 40,000km above earths surface. held in place by earths magnetic field, the van allen radiation belts swell and shrink in response to incoming energy disturbances from the sun . somewhat like the shields created by force fields on star trek pictured that were used to repel alien weapons, we are seeing an invisible shield blocking these electrons, said professor daniel baker . the van allen radiation belts are two layers of charged particles orbiting around earth. they are kept in place by the planets magnetic field. the belts are comprised of an inner and outer belt extending up to 25,000 miles 40,000km above earths surface. the radiation levels across the belts differ depending on where in the belt they are. the belts were discovered in 1958 by scientist james van allen from the university of iowa while aboard the first u.s space mission. one theory suggested the particles were accelerated as they entered the belt and were trapped inside. the second suggested that particles were created inside the belt and accelerated by a force from within. nasa sent probes up to track the behaviour of the belts and these satellites have finally proved that electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge them at super speeds. last year, professor baker led a team that used the twin van allen probes launched in 2012 to discover a third, transient storage ring. this ring is located between the inner and outer van allen radiation belts and seems to come and go with the intensity of space weather. this ring appears to block the ultrafast electrons from breaching the shield and moving deeper towards earths atmosphere. its almost like these electrons are running into a glass wall in space, said professor baker. its an extremely puzzling phenomenon. the team originally thought the highly charged electrons, which are looping around earth at more than 100,000 miles per second, would slowly drift downward into the upper atmosphere. but the impenetrable barrier seen by the twin van allen belt spacecraft stops the electrons before they get that far, said professor baker. the group looked at a number of scenarios that could create and maintain such a barrier. the team wondered if it might have to do with earths magnetic field lines. these lines trap and control protons and electrons, bouncing them between earths poles like beads on a string. they also looked at whether radio signals from human transmitters on earth could be scattering the charged electrons at the barrier, preventing their downward motion. killer electrons whip around the planet at nearlight speed and have been known to threaten astronauts, fry satellites and degrade space systems during intense solar storms . but neither explanation held scientific weight, professor baker said. nature abhors strong gradients and generally finds ways to smooth them out, so we would expect some of the relativistic electrons to move inward and some outward, he added. its not obvious how the slow, gradual processes that should be involved in motion of these particles can conspire to create such a sharp, persistent boundary at this location in space. another scenario is that the giant cloud of cold, electrically charged gas called the plasmasphere, which begins about 600 miles 960km above, is scattering the electrons at the boundary. in march, scientists looking at charged particles in space discovered particle hurricanes surrounding earth. these highlycharged particles are part of the van allen belts. since the belts were first discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to trace the source of the superacceleration. the acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belt. data from nasas twin space probes suggests that these the particles may be supercharged by local acceleration, similar to how hurricanes are driven by the evaporation of warm ocean water on earth. this theory explains why the belts change shape  because the particles numbers swell and drop in different conditions. space scientists believe these findings are significant because they could also be used to explain the highenergy radiation belts that circle saturn and jupiter, as well as around sunlike stars. it could be doing this with low frequency, electromagnetic waves that create a plasmapheric hiss. the hiss sounds like white noise when played over a speaker, professor baker said. while the plasmaspheric hiss may play a role in the puzzling space barrier, professor baker believes there is more to the story. i think the key here is to keep observing the region in exquisite detail, which we can do because of the powerful instruments on the van allen probes, he said. if the sun really blasts the earths magnetosphere with a coronal mass ejection cme, i suspect it will breach the shield for a period of time.","these killer electrons whip around the planet at nearlight speed . if they hit earth, they could knock out power grids

"pensacola, florida cnn  as oil drifted onto beaches as far east as the florida panhandle, a bp official said saturday the company was pleased with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well to a drilling ship a mile above on the gulf of mexico. bp senior vice president bob fryar said the company funneled about 250,000 gallons of oil in the first 24 hours from a containment cap installed on the well to a drilling ship on the ocean surface. that operation has gone extremely well, fryar said at an alabama news conference. we are very pleased. thats about 31 percent of the 798,000 gallons of crude federal authorities estimate is gushing into the sea every day. the companys progress was not enough to temper the frustration seething among residents along the coastline. tony kennon, the mayor of orange beach, alabama, confronted fryar at the afternoon news conference for not acting promptly when reports of tar balls washing ashore surfaced. visibly upset, kennon said local officials have been asking to meet with bp officials for over a month, but their requests went unanswered. if you sensed our frustration, you would have been here a lot sooner, kennon told fryar. people in orange beach are starving to death now because they cant get out to catch the fish. bp engineers are hoping to increase the amount being funneled to the drilling ship but have to be careful about the pressure within the cap that was placed on the well head a few days ago, said coast guard adm. thad allen, the federal governments response manager. allen told reporters at a briefing saturday that bp plans to shut valves in the cap  which are allowing oil to escape  once the pressure is eased. the ultimate capacity of the operation is 630,000 captured gallons a day, still shy of the amount spewing. earlier, coastal residents had anxiously awaited news of bps progress as elevated southerly winds pushed the perimeter of the spilled oil to shorelines as far east as the florida panhandle. the national oceanic and atmospheric administration predicted that scattered tar balls and light sheen would impact beaches as far east as bay county, home to popular destinations in panama city. florida beaches remained open saturday but the number of beachgoers was down. sun and surf were interrupted by sticky brown globs of oil washing up on the sugary sand and workers with blue rubber gloves and plastic bags trying to keep the beach clean. florida gov. charlie crist walked the beach accompanied by margaritaville singer jimmy buffet, who is building a hotel on the pensacola shoreline. i saw some tar balls, crist said. its terrible when you see something like that. it breaks your heart. florida sen. george lemieux, a republican, demanded that bp donate 1 billion for a cleanup fund for the five gulf states and said that president obama needs to push them to do that. i want to see this president more engaged here on the ground, working through problems, lemieux said. the oil slick has already threatened ecologically sensitive lands along the gulf coast. images of oildrenched pelicans were all over the internet, prompting even more public anger toward bp. obama sought in his weekly address saturday to ease fear along the gulf coast by reaffirming his commitment to clean up the worst oil spill in u.s. history. its brutally unfair. its wrong, obama said in the address, recorded a day earlier in grand isle, louisiana. and what i told these men and women  and what i have said since the beginning of this disaster  is that im going to stand with the people of the gulf coast until they are made whole. it appeared that bp was making progress after capping the breached well head, obama said, but he said the federal government was prepared for the worst. he cited a series of statistics that illuminated the largest response to an environmental disaster of this kind in the history of our country. they are as follows . 17,500 national guard troops authorized for deployment. 20,000 people currently working to protect water and coastlines. 1,900 vessels are in the gulf assisting in the cleanup. 4.3 million feet of boom deployed with another 2.9 million feet of boom available, enough to stretch 1,300 miles. 17 staging areas across louisiana, mississippi, alabama, and florida to rapidly defend sensitive shorelines. meanwhile, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration on saturday reopened an area of the gulf to fishing. after reviewing images and data, the agency reopened more than 13,000 square miles west of the florida keys and dry tortugas. at the same time, it closed 2,275square miles off the florida panhandle, extending the northern boundary just east of the western edge of choctawhatchee bay. that means that 32 percent of the gulf still remains offlimits for fishing. the bp well erupted after an explosion and fire on the deepwater horizon drilling rig on april 20. eleven people on board died and the bpleased rig sank two days later, leaving up to 19,000 barrels 798,000 gallons of oil pouring into the gulf daily, according to federal estimates. bp has struggled to contain the gushing oil, trying myriad methods to plug the well and divert the crude. thursday was the first time the british oil giant was able to report progress, when it successfully lowered a containment cap on the ruptured well. even if the funneling procedure is able to contain most of the oil, the solution is temporary, allen said. the gushing well can only be killed after bp completes drilling of two relief wells. allen said the first relief well is about 7,000 feet below the ocean floor. bp will have to go down to between 16,000 and 18,000 feet to be able to intercept the breached well. the longterm threat, allen said, will not go away until a relief well is completed. bp has said the earliest that will be done is august.","new bp official pleased with containment progress . new alabama mayor confronts bp official .

realize that the ancient maya acquired all this building material to erect these buildings, using nothing more than stone tools and quarried the stone, and carried this material on their heads, using tump lines, said the archaeologist. to think that today we have modern equipment, that you can go and excavate in a quarry anywhere, but that this company would completely disregard that and completely destroyed this building. why cant these people just go and quarry somewhere that has no cultural significance? its mindboggling. belizean police said they are . conducting an investigation

only a very limited infrastructure in belize that can be applied to cultural heritage management. unfortunately, they destruction of sites are all too common, but not usually in the center of a large maya site, he said. he said there had probably still been much to learn from the site. a great deal of archaeology was undertaken at nohmul in the 70s and 80s, but this only sampled a small part of this large center. belize isnt the only place where the handiwork of the farflung and enormously prolific maya builders is being destroyed. dominance the mayan empire covered all of the yucatan

showing that it is a major crime and people can and will go to jail for it. robert rosenswig, an archaeologist at the state university of new york at albany, described the difficult and heartbreaking work of trying to salvage information at the nearby site of san estevan following similar destruction around 2005. bulldozing damage at san estevan is extensive and the site is littered with classic period potsherds, he wrote in an academic paper describing the scene. we spent a number of days at the beginning of the 2005 season trying to figure out the extent of the damage .... after scratching our heads for many days, a bulldozer showed up and we realized that what appear to be mounds, when overgrown with chesthigh vegetation, are actually recently bulldozed garbage piles. however small the compensation, bulldozing pyramids is one very brutal way of revealing the inner cores of the structures, which were often built up in periodic stages of construction. the one advantage of this massive destruction, to the core site, is that the remains of early domestic activity are now visible on the surface, mr rosenswig wrote. belize, which shares its rich mayan heritage with neighbouring guatemala, mexico and honduras, is regarded as the heart of the civilisation during the classic period of 250ad to 900ad. it was during this period  the golden age of the empire  that the maya built the great stone cities and monuments that have captured the imagination of explorers and scholars for centuries. classic maya civilisation grew to some 40 cities, and it is thought that the population may have grown to reach two million people at its peak. archaeologists excavating maya sites have uncovered plazas and temples, palaces and pyramids. the heart of classic maya a mayan temple in xunantunich, in the cayo district of western belize . many classic maya temples and palaces were constructed in a stepped pyramid shape, and engraved with elaborate artworks and inscriptions. the maya placed templepyramids at the heart of their great stone cities. one of the best known  the temple of the inscriptions at palenque in mexico  was a monument to the 7th century king hanab pakal. another famous maya structure is the pyramid of the magician at uxmal, mexico. according to maya legend, the pyramid was built by itzamna, god of magic, as a training centre for shamans and healers. maya structures give clues to the importance the civilisation placed on its complex astronomical and cosmological system, with many pyramids deliberately angled to face sunrise or sunset at particular times of the year.",construction workers ravaged 100ft pyramid for rock to use as road fill . learning of damage like being punched in the stomach archaeologist said . ancient structure was part of

"cnn  air canada has seen quite a turnaround. a few years ago, canadas national carrier was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy for a second time in a decade, and at the end of 2011 it reported a 60 million loss. after a yearlong shakeup, however, the onceturbulent company has seen a dramatic rise in profits, and its endofyear earnings for 2012 were 8 million the first time the company had turned a profit in five years. calin rovinescu, the companys ceo, attributes the upturn to his gangnamstyle approach. in a recent issue of the airlines inflight magazine, he wrote . fullservice, established airlines like air canada have to be especially flexible and nimble to avoid becoming the greatuncle launching into a twist at the wedding, whilst the youngsters go gangnam. in other words, air canada realized it had to learn new moves, or, as rovinescu clarifies, get off the dance floor. one of the carriers most prominent restructuring methods is adding 109 more seats to five new boeing 777300ers, and introducing a new premium economy class. i want us to be the leading, premium airline in north america, says rovinescu, who acknowledges there is stiff competition. read more economy class goes gourmet . though theres always a risk that a boosted up economy class will lure a few passengers who would have otherwise booked a more expensive businessclass ticket, rovinescu is confident the move will instead attract a new demographic of economy passengers who want a few extra creature comforts. people that are on the edge of being able to pay for a business class seat may well move to the premium economy, but our expectation is that it will be more than made up by economy class passengers that buy in because they find the pricing of a business class too high. another major move is that the airline has started to launch a bigger presence in the asian market, increasing their routes between toronto and vancouver to beijing, shanghai and hong kong. perhaps the most dramatic change, though, is the addition of a second, lowcost airline, called rouge, which the company is billing as its leisure service. rouge employs smaller planes and travels to separate, more vacationthemed destinations than the main carrier. were a pretty good brand in the leisure market, though word is that we do well on the business travelside internationally. we look at our business and say, well, we could either abandon the leisureside over time, as there will always be an efficient, lower cost producer, or we could get into it in a much more meaningful way. its still too early to see what effect these changes will have on air canadas bottom line in the long run. but the companys recent profit margins bode well. one year does not a transformation make, acknowledges rovinescu, but im really encouraged by the results of last year. i will characterize ourselves as a baseball game. we are probably in the fifth inning right now of a transformation process. read more air canada flight finds stranded australian yacht . the company also faced labor challenges last year with disputes with the airlines two largest unions, the international association of machinists and aerospace workers. the launch of rouge was one point of contention, with airline staff worried about the implications for the safety of their jobs. some of the things we implemented were a little bit of a shock to the airline, a shock to the system. the contracts were all settled and everybody did a great job and went back to work, he says. otherwise, we wouldnt be winning awards, he adds. the accolades he refers to include an award for best international airline in north america for three years running in the world airline awards. the carrier also was named best north american airline for international travel and best north american airline inflight experience as voted on by readers of u.s. magazine business traveler. as rovinescu points out, air canada has a legacy to maintain, and sometimes doing so can be harder than starting from scratch. as significant as it is for an entrepreneur to start a business, its a lot tougher to convert a business that has been around for twenty five years, and thats really what were doing now, he says.","in 2012, air canada turned a profit for the first time in five years . calin rovinescu, the ceo, wrote that the company needed to keep up with the competition by going gangnam one major change was introducing premium economy class . the company also started a lowcost airline called rouge, which has vacationoriented routes .",32,794,3498,0.04030226700251889,4.405541561712846,81,312,794,60,32,3,3498,270,"calin rovinescu, the company's ceo, attributes the upturn to his gangnamstyle approach. rovinescu says he wants us to be the leading, premium airline in north america. he says the move will attract a new demographic of economy passengers."

"cnn  only in the extreme world of bigmountain snowboarding could someone cheat death in an avalanche and realize it had reaffirmed their love of the powder. but perhaps it isnt surprising when xavier de le rue describes his relationship with nature as a need, or a drug. it is also a synergy that provides solace in the wake of bitter disappointment, such as finding out your winter olympics dream is finally over. this huge avalanche took me 2 km down the mountain, the frenchman tells cnns human to hero series of the moment he feared nature had finally beaten him. it was one of these perfect days and you forget that in a split second, things can change radically and then, suddenly the whole mountain broke around me. it is a miracle that i survived because i was lying on top of six meters of snow, completely broken with blood coming out of every hole in my body and completely unconscious. unsurprisingly, that neardeath experience six years ago launched a wave of introspection. i asked myself for months whether i should keep going or not, whether what i was doing was stupid, the 34yearold says. i realized that i loved it even more than i thought and but ive always had these rules in my head to be more scared about everything all the time, but at the same time being a lot more focused. i think that right now, if i am freaked out about safety i will do no compromise. if i dont feel something, ill just go back home. de le rues discipline is boardercross  essentially, a race from the top of a mountain to the bottom between a clutch of snowboarders. he is a fourtime world champion, a threetime winner of the overall world cup title and has three xgames gold medals to his name. the only thing missing from his portfolio of prizes is an olympic medal, having fallen short in 2006 and in 2010. this particular dream is destined go unfulfilled  after dedicating the past year of his life to making next months sochi games, a mixup over qualification points saw him fall short of the benchmark. it was really disappointing to get the news as this was going to be the end of my boardercross career, he explains. after four world champion titles, three xgames medals and three crystal globes, it would have been an amazing way to leave the sport, but it has been a hell of a lot more brutal. the good thing about everything is that my true place in snowboarding, as well as my heart, is in the high mountains riding powder. i am more fit than ever, and i guess this blowup is a great way to start from scratch. i feel a lot lighter in a way, with no pressure. all that energy i have been gathering really makes me look towards my future adventures. there are plenty more to come. chief among them is continuing production on his own films, with expeditions to spitsbergen, in norway, and alaska scheduled, as well as a commentary stint in sochi. watch de le rues mission antarctic it is clear this connection de le rue feels with the mountains is not something that can easily be shaken. snowboarding is many things for me but most of all, snowboarding is what shapes my life in a way, he says. snowboarding is what has taught me to know myself. snowboarding is what has taken me to the most glorious times of my life but also to the worst times of my life. i think its just my own tool to experience life, to push myself, to know my limits, to maybe go over my limits sometimes and to be a happy and fulfilled human being. see de le rue take on the planets steepest peaks . if im in a big city for a while, i start to feel nervous and i know that i need to go back somewhere where there is nothing, where i can touch a tree or a rock or something and then i feel better. de le rue thrives on the thrill of competition  he describes boardercross as like motocross on the snow, as six people battle over a course filled with jumps and obstacles to reach the foot. but he is just as happy in splendid, snowy isolation on top of a mountain. you see those big mountains that are far away and so unreachable, he says. ever since i started snowboarding and skiing, i looked at them and dreamed of getting up there and being up there on my own and even riding them. yeah, the dream came true. i think if i had to describe one feeling that really stands out above everything its the one moment when youre at the top of the mountain, ready to drop in. youre on your own, youre far from everything, and youre in a really strong element. its amazingly beautiful and theres something that happens in your head, its like time doesnt matter anymore. your daily problems just vanish and its indescribable. born in the pyrenees, de le rue started skiing at the tender age of two. his four brothers and sisters also took the slopes at a young age, and his brother paulhenri looks set to make the french team for sochi. but though a medal at the games was his final wish on the competitive side of the sport, he believes boardercross has evolved into a discipline that has maybe pushed the boundaries too far. i think now that the sport has changed, he says. the young guys are hungry and theyre willing to win at any price. im going to sound like an old wise man but i miss the good old times where we used to respect lines, where we used to have a gentlemans code. right now, its just full battle with no rules, in a way. but even if de le rues boardercross days are over, there is plenty more big mountain snowboarding to be done. its a way of kind of getting a bit of control over the mountains but still being humble, asking permission in a way to access it and to ride it and to get this huge immense pride and happiness at the bottom, he explained. everything is recorded in your head and you just go into automatic mode. youre just in a sort of bubble and you dont feel anything, youre just like an animal. once youve gone through all the hard bits and youre straightlining down towards the end, you get this fire exploding inside you.","xavier de le rue is a

"oprah.com  financial columnist michelle singletary maps out a financial rescue plan for tisa mcghee, a 39yearold, single mother of two who has lost her job and watched her debts pile up. heres what you can do if youre in a similar position. in the short term . 1. stick to a budget. i started by giving tisa a blank financial worksheet to fill out. by looking at the full financial picture, i saw some expenses she could cut. first, shes paying 220 a month for cell phones for herself and her daughters. she should stick with the cheapest plan  no downloading ring tones, surfing the internet, or texting for the girls. second, she has to cut back on restaurant meals, one of the most common ways people waste money. third, she needs to spend less on transportation. ideally, 6 to 15 percent of your net income should go to transportation costs including your car payment, gas, and insurance tisa is spending more than 18 percent. i also advised her to make a list of top priorities and, every time shes tempted to buy something, pull out that list and look at it. oprah.com how to be a blackbelt shopper . 2. stay on top of the mortgage. part of tisas trouble is her adjustablerate mortgage. when housing prices were rising, a homeowner could refinance when interest rates went up. but once home prices began to fall, that was no longer an option for many borrowers. while tisas interest rate was rising, the value of her home was dropping  from 302,000 to about 230,000 by last november, according to an estimate by zillow.com. thanks to her emergency fund, she was able to keep up with the higher mortgage payments until august 2008. but then she stopped paying, and the lender began foreclosure proceedings. she eventually sought help through the obama administrations making home affordable program makinghomeaffordable.gov, which allows strapped borrowers to refinance or modify their mortgages. tisas lender offered to lower her monthly payment from 3,180 to 1,747 she began making the new payments last july but stopped because her lender never sent her the proper paperwork. i suggested tisa turn to neighborworks america nw.org, a nonprofit that helps consumers avoid foreclosure, and the agency intervened. if you are having trouble paying your mortgage, you can also contact a free counselor approved by the u.s. department of housing and urban development find one through hopenow.com or at 8889954673. oprah.com unlocking the keys to your mortgage woes . 3. stop making extra debt payments. tisa has been trying to dig herself out of debt by paying more than the minimum on her credit cards. normally that would be smart. but because she is unemployed, i advised her to preserve as much cash as possible, making basic expenses  food, housing, utilities, and transportation  her highest priority. 4. get financial counseling. tisa needs to work oneonone with a credit counselor. counselors with the national foundation for credit counseling can provide free or lowcost debt help. to find a counselor, go to debtadvice.org or call 8003882227. look for accredited counselors who have independent certification and training in budgeting, consumer credit, and debt management. oprah.com 9 small steps that will pay off next year . in the long term . 1. stop using shopping as therapy. emotional spending causes a lot of people to end up in serious debt. seventynine percent of women go on spending sprees to cheer themselves up, according to a 2009 study released by the university of hertfordshire, in england. forty percent of the women surveyed named depression as a reason to go shopping. 2. save to buy a used car. tisa, who has spent almost 30,000 over the past six years on two leased cars, needs to eke out some money to pay cash for a used car when her current lease is up. yes, you can lease a car for less each month than it would cost you to buy the same vehicle, but at the end of that lease, you have no car. in the long term, buying a car and keeping it for years saves more money. 3. aggressively pay down debt. after tisa starts working fulltime again, she needs to follow what i call the debt dash plan list your debts, starting with the smallest. take all the extra money you can find in your budget and apply it to that debt, and make only the minimum payments on your other debts. when you pay off the first debt, move on to the one with the next lowest balance, and so on. this strategy works because people get an emotional boost from eliminating one of their debts quickly, which motivates them to stick to their debt repayment plan. 4. pay down student loans. once tisa is back on her feet financially, she must start paying off her student loans, because the interest is killing her. an incomebased repayment plan for her federal loans will cap her monthly payment at an affordable amount based on income and family size. for information about this plan, go to ibrinfo.org her lender will determine her eligibility and how much she must pay each month. but, in exchange for lower monthly payments, she may end up paying more interest than under a standard tenyear repayment plan. 5. build the consulting business. tisa has already started her business, mc3 consulting inc., which teaches nonprofits how to improve their services and internal operations. mc3 consulting is the seed i am planting for my girls, she says. i want them to see their mother be successful and show them that we can turn this situation around. i want them to learn from my mistakes. tisa has a good business plan and great contacts, but until she has enough contracts to cover all her expenses and debt, she needs to pursue and stay in a fulltime job. she should continue to seek advice, especially to steer clear of tax problems. one place to start is score score.org, a nonprofit association of working and retired executives and business owners who donate their time to advising entrepreneurs. tisa has been financially solid before, and she can do it again. she needs to set a budget, get rid of her debts, and keep spending in check. recognizing her issues is a big part of the battle. a combination of factors led me to where i am today, she said, but i cant regret those things. theyre helping me become the woman i hope to be someday. oprah.com 25 ways to save a bundle . by michelle singletary from o, the oprah

hospital in merseyside, after he carried it as a weapon . he committed some of the most notorious crimes of the 20th century but moors murderer ian brady is now reduced to targeting those he dislikes by smearing jam and honey on their furniture. the child killer regularly wipes the spreads on a chair used by a patient he bears a grudge against, and spills cereal near anothers room, a mental health tribunal heard yesterday. according to a psychiatrist treating brady at ashworth secure hospital, his bizarre surreptitious revenge is a response to being incapable of physical violence as a frail 75yearold. dr james collins, who brady has refused to speak to since beginning a hunger strike over a decade ago, cited the breakfastthemed campaign as evidence of his paranoid schizophrenia. brady also believed he could talk to laurel and hardy, cilla black and indira gandhi, dr collins added. brady, who won the right to have the tribunal held in public, is being forcefed, but wants to be sent back to prison in the belief he will be able to starve himself to death. the hearing is taking place behind closed doors at the merseyside hospital, but proceedings are being relayed to a courtroom in manchester. dr collins, bradys medical officer for more than a decade, said the killer regularly smeared jam or honey on a chair in the wards day room used by a patient referred to as r. he described the tactic as surreptitious revenge by other means, prompted by bradys failing health. when he was younger, he would have it out with these guys, he explained. hes now frail and elderly. the smearing of jam and honey on this guys chair in the day area is clearly designed to wind him up. dr collins said there was no justification for bradys campaign against r, which could only be explained by delusions caused by mental illness. bradys foodrelated campaign also extends to spilling cereal outside the door to a patients room, the psychiatrist said. the mental health tribunal is taking place behind closed doors at ashworth hospital on merseyside . two faces of a killer a sketch of brady at the tribunal hearing yesterday, feeding tube in nose, and, right, in 1965 when he was last seen .

target of an incident last year when brady accused him of making pig noises. dr collins gave more details of the . incident, describing how it culminated in brady holding an uncapped pen . in the face of another occupant of the ward in the style of a weapon. brady, a prolific letterwriter, was later banned from having a pen. along with myra hindley, who died in . 2002, brady killed five children between 1963 and 1965 and buried them . on saddleworth moor. he is expected to give evidence next week. moors murderer ian brady was glimpsed yesterday in the tribunal room at the maximum security

murder victim lesley ann downey, who was just 10 when she was sadistically murdered . yesterday at the tribunal it was revealed brady plotted to break out of his maximum security hospital with a female visitor. brady gave the woman cash, clothes . and a picture of himself as he seduced her in an effort to get out of . ashworth secure hospital in merseyside. his personal clinician told a panel of experts that it was clearly a preparation for an escape, which ultimately failed. the hearing was told the killer, 75, has also claimed to be in communication with a reincarnated nazi and believed he could change the laws of physics. the tribunal is being held as brady seeks to be released from the hospital so he can die at a prison in scotland. describing . the delusions which led to his being detained at ashworth in 1985, dr . james collins said brady had also complained of being controlled by . green beings. at one stage, he said brady had been exchanging letters with a woman he believed to be a reincarnated nazi. he told a prison visitor that he could change the laws of physics and walk through locked doors at night, he added. dr . collins is bradys responsible medical officer at ashworth but said the . mass murderer had refused to engage with him for more than a decade. he . believes brady continues to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia, . recounting how the delusions escalated in the 1980s when he began adding . excessive amounts of salt to his food. brady would wait for fellow prisoners to finish their meals then take plates of custard, gravy or rice pudding to his cell. there he would add salt piled like snow and eat until he vomited while cursing himself and beating the walls. asked why, brady replied i like salt. dr collins said this was a . ridiculous answer and in reality showed that brady thought his food . was being tampered with a psychotic symptom, he added. although no further details of the escape plot were revealed, dr collins used it as an example of the killers powers of manipulation. he . told the hearing it was clearly a preparation for an escape. there is . no doubt at all about that. he opened up to this woman more than anyone . else. brady also walked out of his mental health tribunal yesterday, complaining he had listened to this ad nauseam. but he was quickly slapped down by the judge who warned him we will hear the evidence. innocent keith bennett left and john kilbride right were murdered by ian brady and myra hindley. keiths body is still missing. brady has never revealed the whereabouts of the 12yearolds body

"grammar schooleducated british jihadist shabazz suleman claims turkish police fed him dominos pizza in jail before handing him over to isis in a prisoner exchange which led to a diplomatic storm . a grammar schooleducated british jihadist has claimed turkish police fed him dominos pizza in jail before handing him over to isis in a prisoner exchange which led to a diplomatic storm. shabazz suleman, 19, a former pupil at the royal grammar school in high wycombe, was among as many as 180 fighters handed back to islamic state by turkey in return for the release of diplomats. the swap, involving 46 turkish citizens and three local iraqi staff who were captured when is stormed the iraqi city of mosul in june, has sparked a diplomatic row, with turkey already under pressure from fellow un members to secure its borders with syria. speaking for the first time since the deal in september, suleman has claimed he and fellow captives were able to contact isis from internet in their cells, and that the turkish police guarding him had expressed sympathy with their cause  and even bought them pizza. cops were very friendly, suleman told the times john simpson and alex

good lol. had pizza in prison. dominos lol. was allowed net. we spoke to dawla isis in prison. watched isis videos. sang nasheeds islamic chants. suleman, who now calls himself abu shamil almuslim, is thought to have joined jihadis in syria after giving his parents the slip to cross the border while on holiday in turkey. the teenager, who was described by his old school as a valued, hardworking student, had achieved good alevel results last summer and had a place lined up to study at keele university, where he had wanted to studyinternational relations. former pupils at his old school include secretary of state for justice chris grayling, comedian jimmy carr, england rugby players nick beale, matt dawson, and tom rees, golfer luke donald and singer ian dury. in a statement released in october, after news emerged that suleman had gone to syria, the school said during his time at rgs, shabazz was a very engaging and amiable student who fitted in well, forming good relationships with his peers and staff. shabazz had a good work ethic, and was prepared to play a prominent role in class discussions, even though he gave the impression of being a rather reserved and quiet person. suleman pictured claims he and fellow captives were able to contact isis from internet in their cells, and that the turkish police guarding him had expressed sympathy with their cause  and even bought them pizza . he showed real determination to achieve good academic results, working hard to build on his as grades to achieve a solid set of a levels in history, economics and psychology and so gained a place at university. shabazz was a valued, hardworking student who achieved well and respected the schools academic and pastoral ethos. but suleman, who had travelled to aleppo, syria with an aid convoy in 2013,is believed to have been radicalised by jihadis he met on twitter. he is also thought to have attended the muslim education centre in high wycombe, where one of the british men convicted in the 2006 transatlantic liquid bomb plot also attended. it is around the corner from the teenagers 400,000 detached family home. sulemans mother had previously denied claims he has travelled to the middle east for violent reasons, telling the press he has gone to do aid work there. the muslim education centre has said it was shocked by sulemans departure and has condemned the activities of isis. his parents had reported him missing to both british police and the turkish authorities, and the foreign and commonwealth office had also reported him missing. suleman, who received weapons training at a twoweek sharia training camp, said he had been caught by security services at the syrian border. he said he was visited twice by turkish intelligence agency mit, fined, and told he was going to be deported. the teenager, described by royal grammar school, high wycombe pictured as a valued, hardworking student, had achieved good alevel results last summer and had a place lined up to study at keele university . he said he was held along with 35 other isis fighters at an open prison in sanliurfa, around an hour from the turkishsyrian border. suleman, who is now in raqqa where his duties involve being on sentry guard, said he had been given the choice of being deported, or being part of the isis exchange. he wrote after a month of waiting they told us buses are waiting outside for u. mit ran the exchange. told us we are free. exchanged at border, we drove into dawla. three french citizens, two swedes, two macedonians, one swiss, and one belgian are also believed to have been part of the exchange, as well as another briton, hisham folkard, 26. the deal is understood to have been brokered through complex talks with tribes and rebel militia.","shabazz

"by . matt chorley, mailonline political editor . published . 0336 est, 30 october 2013 .  . updated . 1101 est, 30 october 2013 . new rules on what can pass for jam and marmalade will spell the end of the british breakfast as we know it, the government has been warned. cutting the amount of sugar which must be used to call something jam will leave people eating the coloured mud favoured by the french, germans and americans, lib dem mp tessa munt claims. the aide to business secretary vince cable warns new regulations will mean jam is less tasty, dull in colour and will not last as long. history traditional, sweet english jam could become a thing of the past with people forced to buy frenchstyle fruit butter, the government has been warned . ministers argue that cutting the minimum sugar level of jam from 60 per cent to 50 per cent will make it easier and more lucrative for british producers to export their goods. the change will initially only affect england, but scotland, wales and northern ireland are expected to follow suit. but ms munt, mp for wells in somerset, used a debate in parliament today to call on the government to think again. warning lib dem mp tessa munt dismissed low sugar jams as coloured mud she warns that customers will not know . what they are buying, and instead of glossy traditional jams will . instead be forced to buy fruit butter. im actually quite worried because i think this is going to be the end of the british breakfast as we know it, she told the bbc. ms munt went on our jams and marmalades are so important  and we know what to expect when we go into the supermarket or into our local shop or farm shops locally, we know exactly what were going to buy when something says jam on it  or marmalade or jelly  we know exactly what to expect. at the minute, weve got a jam that we know exactly what its like. its a fantastic colour, a really good shelf life, its going to last a year. its beautiful consistency its got a gloss to it. if these regulations change, well end up with something much more like the french and german product  and worse still the americans  where they have things a bit like a fruit butter or a fruit spread. its dull colours that dont taste the same and they certainly dont last as long. fears critics of the governments plans say that in future jam on sale in england will not be as brightly coloured . the idea that a fruit preserve must be 60 per cent sugar dates back to the 1920s. supporters argue it is necessary to ensure the sugar acts as a preservative, giving them a longer shelf life. by reducing the minimum sugar levels, the jam will have to be boiled for longer to ensure it sets, and as a result the fruits will lose their colour and taste. however, some producers argue it will make little difference because reduced sugar jam already sold in this country must contain less than 50 per cent sugar. paul gorman, from small producer clippys, said tessa munts arguments are absolute nonsense. jam already legally exists with sugar levels of 50 per cent or less. legally, this has to be called reduced sugar jam. the issue is that there is a jams nomans land between 5159 per cent where there is basically no law. the government claims that many manufacturers want the changes to be made. during the debate in westminster hall, ms munt said we all know what we expect when we go to the supermarket  something that is of beautiful quality, beautiful colour and it has a shelf life of about a year. by reducing the percentage of total sugar, the characteristic gellike consistency of jams and marmalade will be lost. the result will be an homogenised spreadable sludge that does not bear any resemblance to what we know in england and what we enjoy as british jam. with a 60 sugar content, the colours of sweet preserves are bright and characteristic of the fruit used to make the product. the fruit is fantastic. a lower percentage produces products with darker, muddier colours which may affect consumer confidence in the british product. in addition, if the consistency lacks the characteristic gel and is instead more like a fruit spread or a fruit butter, consumer confidence in the properties of jam and similar products may be lost. environment minister george eustice said the government intended to support the proposal because manufacturers would still be able to make jam with 60 per cent sugar. speaking in the debate, mr eustice said the reduction in the minimum sugar levels to 50 per cent delivers the greatest flexibility to the industry as a whole in a way that i do not think will be detrimental to those who are in compliance with the regulations. the regulations drawn up by the uk government have been approved by the eu and are now making their way through a series of committees. tory mp tobias ellwood said the government should consider introducing a kite mark for all jams with 60 per cent sugar content. and tory mp priti patel said the government should be helping british producers to export their jam around the world. in a jam make the most of strawberries  try our recipe for the perfect jam . step one . step two . step three . to make 2.5kg 5lb 8oz of

pictured, claimed a personal assistant signed off contracts worth more than 30 million as part of the universal credit programme . a personal assistant signed off contracts worth more than 30 million as part of the governments flagship universal credit programme, a report claims today. a damning study from mps warned that the implementation of the allinone tax and benefits system was marred by shocking failures that had wasted at least 140 million. it had been blighted by alarmingly weak management with lowgrade civil servants allowed to authorise payments worth millions of pounds. in some cases, it was unclear what suppliers had been paid for, the public accounts committee said. the department for work and pensions had neglected to implement basic procedures for monitoring and authorising expenditure, it alleged. we saw evidence that purchase orders with a total value of 8.7 million were approved by a personal assistant to the programme director, the mps said. in another case, two purchase orders, one for 22.6 million and one for 1.1 million, were approved by a personal assistant to the programme director whose delegated financial authority at the time of approvals was only 10 million. some individual payments to suppliers could also not be linked to pieces of work delivered. it programmes worth 140 million had to be written off because they were unusable. mps also warned the 2.3 billion universal credit programme could not meet its deadline to be fully delivered by 2017. a pilot of the scheme was branded inadequate as it was open to fraud. the trial was also limited to only the simplest new claims of those who were single and had no dependents. universal credit is due to replace six meanstested benefits in four years time. work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith insisting it can ensure people are always better off in jobs and save 38 billion by 2023. but pac chairman, labours margaret hodge, said the implementation so far had been extraordinarily poor. the report claimed that it programmes worth 140 million had to be written off because they were unusable file picture the failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet to be determined amount of public money, she said, adding 425 million has been spent so far on the programme. it is likely that much of this, including at least 140 million worth of it assets, will now have to be written off. the management of the programme has been alarmingly weak. from the outset, the department has failed to grasp the nature and enormity of the task failed to monitor and challenge progress regularly and, when problems arose, failed to intervene promptly. lack of daytoday control meant early warning signs were missed, with senior managers becoming aware of problems only through ad hoc reviews. a spokeswoman for iain duncan smith, pictured, said action had been taken to fix the problems with universal credit . she also attacked the department for its fortress culture and deluding itself by reporting only good news while problems were denied. mps said the project would not hit its current target of enrolling 184,000 claimants by april 2014. committee member and tory mp richard bacon said in developing it projects, government departments can no longer be allowed to mark their own homework. labours frank field, a former social security minister, said labour should show the courage to scrap this monster of a project and provide voters with a real and positive alternative  a something for something welfare state with national insurance at its heart and a cap on meanstested benefits. a spokeswoman for iain duncan smith said both the nao national audit office and the pac acknowledged a fortress mentality within the universal credit programme. iain was clear back in the summer about how he and the permanent secretary took action to fix those problems. he has every confidence with the team now in place, and that team includes robert devereux the permanent secretary. a dwp spokeswoman said that the department did not recognise the 140 million write off figure. she added no contracts were signed off by a personal assistant. they were agreed by the relevant programme authority and the pa simply completed the administration processes necessary. however, stronger financial controls have been put in place so that this doesnt happen again. universal credit is a vital reform that rewards work instead of trapping people on benefits. it will ultimately bring a 38bn economic benefit to society. this report doesnt take into account our new leadership team, or our progress on delivery. we have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial
